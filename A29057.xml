            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOu may have obſerv'd as well as I, that ſince the publiſhing of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments I ſent you, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Reſpiration,</hi> divers of our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men have ſpent both Thoughts and Diſcourſes in inquiring and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, Whether there reſide in the heart of Animals, ſuch a fine and kindled, but mild, Subſtance, as they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58466:5"/>call a <hi>Vital Flame,</hi> to whoſe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as to that of other flames, the <hi>Air,</hi> (eſpecially as 'tis taken in, and expell'd again by Reſpiration) is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. This among other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations makes me think it ſeaſonable (though many avocations make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient) to compleat the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Promiſe I made you, by adding to the Experiments about Reſpiration, which your commands have already obtain'd of me, thoſe ſcatter'd <hi>Notes,</hi> that I have been able to pick up about the <hi>Relation</hi> betwixt <hi>Flame</hi> and <hi>Air:</hi> And though, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, they are very much inferior in number to the Tryals about Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that in making them it was not ſo much my Deſign to compleat an intire and diſtinct Tract, though but a ſmall one, of ſuch Experiments, as to gratifie my own curioſity in the examining of a Paradox or two I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58466:5"/>had been writing about Flame; yet the nobleneſs of the Queſtion now under debate, and their pertinenoy to it, will poſſibly keep them, as few as they are, from being uſeleſs. And that alſo they may be the better kept from being unwelcome, I have choſen to make my ſelf a Relater of matters of fact, without ingaging with either of the Litigant parties in a Controverſie, wherein I am the leſs tempted to be partial, becauſe I have not formerly declared my opinion about it, and at preſent, I ſee, on <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſide, Perſons for whom I have no ſmall reſpect and kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> that you may not expect in the following Papers ſuch a number and variety of Experiments as I might perhaps be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you with, on ſome more tractable ſubject; I ſhall briefly mention to you ſome of the chief difficulties I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58466:6"/>met with in the making of theſe; which I do the rather, that, if you and your ingenious friends have a mind to proſecute ſuch Tryals, you may not be ſurpris'd with the difficulties I have met with; but provide at leaſt againſt thoſe fore-ſeen ones, by which you will ſcarce fail to be encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall then inform you, that the enſuing experiments were rendred uneaſie and troubleſome to me by this; that ſome of them could not be conveniently done at all ſeaſons of the year, nor in any ſeaſon in all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but muſt be made not only in the day time, but in Sun-ſhine days. You will eaſily gheſs, that I ſpeak of thoſe experiments, that are to be made by the help of a Burning-glaſs, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reflected or refracted beams of the Sun upon the combuſtible matter plac'd in the exhauſted Receiver:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58466:6"/>For, by reaſon of the interpoſition of ſo thick a Glaſs, whereby many of the incident beams of Light are reflected, and others inconveniently refracted; there is ordinarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite a clear day, and a competent height of the Sun above the <hi>Horizon;</hi> and ſometimes alſo a convenient time of the year; to bring ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as we were ſpeaking of, to a fair Tryal. Not to take notice, that in ſuch attempts there uſually inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene circumſtantial difficulties, not ſo eaſie to be fore-ſeen: And it not being Summer when I had occaſion to make the following Experiments, I could make but very few with the Sun-beams; beſides that there are divers others which are not that way to be made ſo conveniently, if at all, as by the help of the Fire.</p>
                  <p>But though the Tryals of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort had their <hi>conveniencies,</hi> in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58466:7"/>regard they might be made in any weather, and as well by night, as day; yet they were not unattended with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>inconveniencies:</hi> ſome of which you will eaſily diſcern by the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, that was neceſſary to be made in ſome of the relations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And, beſides more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and emergent difficulties, there was this in general, that render'd theſe Experiments troubleſome; that, whether I made them in larger Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or in ſmall, or in middle-ſized ones, each of theſe caſes had its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies: For, very large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, beſides that 'twas very toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tedious to empty them of Air, required ſo much time for the exhauſtion, that too frequently, by that time the <hi>Operator</hi> had done pumping, the included Iron, or other heated body, was grown too cold to perform the deſired effect: And if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58466:7"/>the Receiver were not conſiderably large, then the red-hot Iron, or other included body that was to burn the combuſtible matter, would much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the breaking of the over-heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Glaſs, and not afford room enough for ſome <hi>Phaenomena</hi> to be fairly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in; and beſides create another difficulty, to which we found mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-ſized Receivers alſo obnoxious: For, ſeveral times when the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment required an intenſe heat within the Receiver, then (eſpecially if ſome caſual obſtacle hinder'd the quick exhauſtion) the heat of the ignited Iron, or ſome ſuch other included body, would ſo melt or ſoften the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that faſten'd the Receiver to the Engine, that, when the Glaſs was brought to be well exhauſted, and ſometimes alſo before, the external air would by its preſſure and fluidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſqueeze or thruſt in ſomewhere or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58466:8"/>other the yielding Cement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cauſe in the Inſtrument a leak, that would much incommodate us, if not reduce us to begin the Experiment again, in ſo much that for ſome tryals we were fain to provide a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on purpoſe: the leaſt fuſible, that we uſed on other occaſions, being yet found too fuſible on theſe.</p>
                  <p>Nor were thoſe, I have already mentioned, the only difficulties and impediments I met with in making experiments about <hi>Flame</hi> and <hi>Air;</hi> but I ſhall not here trouble you with them in this place, where it may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for me to have mentioned thoſe that are of a more general nature, and are like the moſt frequently to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr.</p>
                  <p>But though I declin'd to name any other to you, than the foregoing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties <hi>in making</hi> the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments; yet I muſt not omit to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58466:8"/>take notice of one that may occurr to you about <hi>judging</hi> of them. For, in thoſe tryals that require to have an ignited Iron or any ſuch thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Receiver, it would uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happen, that ſo much heat would rarifie the Air ſhut up in the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Gage, and conſequently inable it to depreſs the Mercury, that lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, far beneath the mark it would have ſtaid at upon the meer account of ſo much ambient Air pump'd out: This would happen, I ſay, before the heated Receiver was well exhauſted; ſo that, if one be not aware of this, 'twill be obvious, by looking on the Gage, to conclude the Receiver to be well emptied, before it really is ſo. And therefore the ſafeſt way in theſe caſes is, to continue to pump (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out truſting to the ordinary marks) till you ſee that the Mercury will be no further depreſſed in the ſealed leg
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58466:9"/>of the Gage; though otherwiſe, by concurring ſigns, one that is vers'd in thoſe tryals may well enough judge when he needs to pump no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps you will here demand, whether by our Engine we can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently withdraw the Air out of a Receiver; or whether at leaſt that may not be much better done by the help of Quick-ſilver, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, in regard that ponderous liquor frees the glaſs, it deſerts, from all the Air at once, and exactly hinders the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of it.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer whereunto, I hope you do not expect, that I ſhould contend for a favourabler judgement of the Engine, I employ, than the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> (as well Foreign as Engliſh) have been pleaſed to paſs on it already: And therefore, to tell you freely my
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58466:9"/>thoughts, about the main part of the propos'd Queſtion, I ſhall readily avow to you, that I think, there may be experiments (ſuch as ſome of thoſe where the included body need be but ſmall, and where the being ſuddenly produc'd is chiefly deſired in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,) wherein, by the help of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, the exhauſtion of the Air may be diſpatch'd with greater celerity, and conſequently make the effect be more conſpicuous, than, <hi>by our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of trying,</hi> it would be in our Engine; ſince the fall of the Mercury does, as the objection intimates, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>Vacuum</hi> (in our ſence of that word) very nimbly, whereby the Expanſion of the Air is preſently ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and the Aereal particles, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in the pores of any body plac'd in this deſerted cavity, will thereby have opportunity more ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to expand themſelves. But,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58466:10"/>on the other ſide, I might anſwer in general, that when I have particular occaſions to diſpatch the exhauſtion of the Air, I can very much haſten it, by barely leſſening, as I have ſeveral times done, the capacity of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; inſomuch that I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times imployed ſo ſmall an one, that in half a minute, or much leſs, after it was fitted on, we could conſiderably exhauſt it, and thereby produce <hi>Phaenomena</hi> exceeding conſpicuous. And as to the Experiments of this little Tract in particular, it may be ſaid, that, not to mention the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſomneſs, and other inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of needing to imploy ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy weight of Mercury, you will eaſily find, by the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the inſuing tryals, that moſt of them cannot be with any conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and ſome of them not at all, made in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> tubes. As
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58466:10"/>for the ground of the Objection, that the Air cannot be ſo well drawn out by our way, as by the ſubſiding of the Mercury; though you may think that very clear, yet one, that were very jealous of the Reputation of the inſtrument I employ, may perhaps reaſonably enough queſtion it. For, the <hi>Vacuum,</hi> that is produced in the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, as 'tis made all at once, ſo 'tis made once for all; and therefore if there were any Aereal particles lurking in the Mercury (as there will be pretty ſtore, if the quantity of that liquor be great enough to make a conſiderable <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> which if it be not, it will be too ſmall for very many of our tryals;) they will remain in the deſerted cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the top of the Glaſs, and, by their expanſion there, much hinder the full operation of an ambient <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> upon the bodies plac'd in it.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58466:11"/>Befides that almoſt all ſuch bodies, if they be dry, will be ſo incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Mercury (which ſcarce ſticks to any conſiſtent bodies but metals,) that probably there will be no ſmall number of aereal corpuſcles inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted between the Mercury and thoſe ſurfaces, to which it does not cloſely adhere: which aery corpuſcles, when the ſubſiding Mercury deſerts them, will be left to increaſe the number of thoſe, that, (as we were ſaying) will emerge from the Mercury; from which, as alſo from the pores of the included bodies, will perhaps ariſe divers new ones from time to time for a pretty while after. And in caſe the <hi>Vacuum</hi> be made by a <hi>Cylinder</hi> of two or three and thirty foot of water, (as for ſome experiments, that have been tried in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> hath been done) the emerſion of bubles may laſt a long time, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58466:11"/>from ſome obſervations of mine elſewhere related.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, in our Engine, though when the Receivers are not very ſmall, they are more ſlowly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied; yet in recompence, we may continue the pumping out of the Air as long, and renew it in the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment as often as we think fit: So that, if we perceive, that, after the firſt exhauſtion of the Glaſs, there happen any aereal particles to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves ſucceſſively out of the included body, we can, by reſuming the Pump from time to time, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever need requires, free the <hi>Vacuum</hi> from theſe alſo; which, in ſome caſes, I have found to be longer and more copiouſly emitted by the included bodies, than any thing but jealous tryals could have convinc'd me of. And to confirm what I have been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſomething Hiſtorical, I ſhall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58466:12"/>add; That though the excellent <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine Academians</hi> are thought to have proſecuted the Experiments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Vacuum</hi> made with Mercury the furtheſt of any; yet ſome eminent members of that Illuſtrious Society were pleaſed to confeſs to me, that they never were able by the help of Mercury, to bring a Glaſs-buble, ſeal'd up with Air in it, to burſt of it ſelf by the withdrawing of the external Air; which yet I have often done with the Engine I employ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them, that I could do ſo by doing it in their preſence.</p>
                  <p>You will, perhaps, think it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange, to find, that I ſet down ſome of the following Narratives in ſuch a way, as does not expreſs me ſollicitous to aſcribe and vindicate to the Air ſo abſolute and equal a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to the production and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58466:12"/>of all <hi>Flames,</hi> as divers Learned men have concluded from my former Experiments. But I, that am content to be kind to the Air, but not partial, ſhall not ſcruple to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you, that, as much as ſome may think me beholden to the Air for any diſcoveries of it ſelf, it may have vouchſaf'd me; yet, I think, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as well as a civil Hiſtorian, does, in his accounts of matters of fact, owe more to Truth than to Gratitude it ſelf. And though, where-ever the Air can challenge a clear, or at leaſt a probable intereſt in a <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> I am not only diſpos'd, but glad to do it right; yet I would not eaſily aſſert to it a larger Juriſdiction than I find Nature to have aſſigned it; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince (without partiality) <hi>that,</hi> I preſume, may be ſhewn to be very large and conſiderable, and perhaps to reach to many things, wherewith
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58466:13"/>men ſeem not to have yet taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that it hath any thing to do at all.</p>
                  <p>What hath been hitherto ſaid, will not, I hope, ſeem impertinent or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, whenever you ſhall fall upon the actual making of ſuch Experiments as you are about to read. But I fear, that to add any thing more, (which were not difficult for me to do to the preliminary part of this ſmall Tract) would make it too diſproportionate to the hiſtorical; From which I ſhall therefore no longer detain you.</p>

                           <p>HAving hitherto examin'd by the <hi>preſence</hi> of the Air, what intereſt it has in kindling of Flame; it will not be impertinent to add an Experiment or two, that we tried to ſhew the ſame intereſt of the Air by the effects of its <hi>admiſſion</hi> into our <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum.</hi> For I thought, it might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be ſuppoſed, that if ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were introduc'd into a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as that there ſhould not appear any thing wanting to turn it into Flame but the preſence of the Air, an actual accenſion of that body might be produced by the admitted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58466:17"/>Air, without the intervention of any actual Flame, or Fire, or even heated ſubſtance; the warrantableneſs of which ſuppoſition may be judged by the two following Experiments.</p>
                           <p>When we had made the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ere long to be related in its due place, <hi>(viz. Title</hi> II. Exper. the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>) to examine the preſumption we had, that even when the Iron was not hot enough to keep the melted Brimſtone in ſuch a heat, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make it burn without Air, or with very little, it would yet be hot enough to kindle the Sulphur, if the Air had acceſs to it: To examine this (I ſay) we made two or three ſeveral Tryals, and found by them, that if ſome little while after the flame was extinguiſhed, the Receiver were removed, the Sulphur would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently take fire again, and flame as vigorouſly as before. But I thought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58466:18"/>it might without abſurdity be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether or no the agency of the Air in the production of the flame might not be ſomewhat leſs than theſe trials would perſwade; becauſe that, by taking off the Receiver, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur was not only expoſed to freſh Air, but alſo advantaged with a free ſcope for the avolation of thoſe fumes, which in a cloſe Veſſel might be preſum'd to have been unfriendly to the Flame.</p>
                           <p>How far this doubt may, and how far it ſhould, be admitted, we may be aſſiſted to diſcern by the ſubjoyned experiment, though made in great part for another purpoſe; which you will perceive by the beginning of the Memorial I made of it, that runs thus.</p>

Then, without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Receiver, we let in at the ſtop-cock very warily a little Air, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we could perceive, though
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58466:19"/>not a conſtant flame, yet divers little flaſhes, as it were, which diſcloſed themſelves by their blew colour to be ſulphureous flames; and yet the Air that had ſuffic'd to re-kindle the Sulphur, was ſo little, that two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuctions more drew it out again, and quite depriv'd us of the mentioned flaſhes. And when a little Air was cautiouſly let in again at the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, the like flaſhes began again to appear, which upon two exuctions more did again quite vaniſh, though, upon the letting in a little freſh Air the third time, they did once more reappear.</p>

Yet there appeared upon the iron-plate a pretty broad blew flame, like that of brimſtone (whence 'twas judg'd to be the Sulphureous ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of the Gunpowder that was kindled) which laſted ſo very long as we could not but wonder at it. But at length the Powder not going off, and the ſtill decaying heat of the iron forbidding us to wait any longer, we thought fit to take off the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, &amp; found (as we expected) that the Paper contiguous to the Iron, was, in part, deſtroy'd by its heat; but moſt of the grains of the Powder ſeem'd not alter'd, and were found diſpos'd enough to be fired, notwithſtanding the conſumption of the brimſtone, that had burn'd away.</p>

                           <p>TO confirm the foregoing Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, by ſhewing how great a diſpoſition to take fire there may be in Gunpowder, that yet would not do ſo without Air, I ſhall ſubjoyn this obſervation:</p>
                           <p>Having reiterated the newly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Experiment after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with the ſame Receiver, and Iron-plate, as formerly, we did not find any exploſion to be made for ſo long a time, that, thinking it in vain to wait any farther, we let in the Air, which might perhaps, by help of the remaining heat of the iron, procure the operation we at firſt deſired. The event was; that after nothing had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued for a good while, and we ſcarce thought, that ſuch a thing would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; the Powder ſuddenly went off
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58466:23"/>with a great flaſh, and ſo ſhook the Receiver that was yet ſtanding on the Engine, as to endanger the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it down. Which circumſtance I mention, to give you a caution that may prove uſeful, in caſe you try in cloſe veſſels experiments with Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder; ſince if they be not warily managed, they may ſometimes (as I have had occaſion to obſerve) prove dangerous enough; which will be the better diſcern'd, if I add, that the Powder, that had this operation on a Receiver (large enough to contain two Gallons of liquor) was weigh'd before it was put in, and amounted but to one grain, (though a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity might perhaps have been well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ventur'd upon, if it had been but <hi>common</hi> Gunpowder.)</p>

                           <p>Into a pretty large and ſtrong Glaſs-buble, we put a few ſmall corns of Gunpowder, and having carefully exhauſted it, and ſecur'd it againſt the return of the Air, we put it upon a pretty quantity of Live-coals ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially cover'd with Aſhes: By whoſe heat the ſulphureous ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the Powder was in part kindled, and burn'd blew for a pretty while, and with a flame conſiderably great
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58466:24"/>(in proportion to the Powder;) upon whoſe ceaſing, the Powder, which, when all was done, did not take fire, appear'd to have ſent up, beſides the flame, a pretty deal of ſulphureous ſublimate, that ſtuck to the upper part of the Glaſs, and being held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Candle, we caus'd to be brought in, (for the Experiment had been purpoſely made in a dark place) it exhibited divers vivid colours like thoſe of the Rain-bow.</p>

                           <p>THough, in the fourteenth of the long ſince publiſh'd Phyſico-Mechanical Experiments, there is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58466:24"/>recited a tryal made about kindling of Gunpowder with a Piſtol; yet I ſhall not forbear to ſubjoyn the inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account, <hi>partly</hi> becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver we then imploy'd, being about four times, if I miſ-remember not, as big as that we laſt made uſe of, 'twas very difficult to exhauſt the one ſo well as the other; and <hi>partly</hi> becauſe we wanted ſome accommodations, with which we ſince furniſh'd our ſelves, and (having not then devis'd the Mercurial Gage we imploy'd in the making this laſt Experiment) we could not then judge ſo well, as we ſince could, of the degrees to which the Receiver was emptied. And therefore, when in the Relation of that fourteenth tryal there is mention made of one attempt that did ſucceed, among divers that did not; there is towards the cloſe an intimation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, That in ſpite of the great Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58466:25"/>that had been made in the Air, there might yet be ſome little portion of it remaining in the Receiver. I proceed then to the promiſed Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I find thus ſet down:</p>
                           <p>To proſecute the deſign of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Experiment by a way ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing from thoſe hitherto mention'd; we made, though not without difficulty, the enſuing tryal; one of whoſe ſcopes you will find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated at the cloſe of the Relation.</p>
                           <p>We took a ſmall and very ſhort Piſtol, and having well faſten'd it with ſtrings to a great weight, that was plac'd upon the iron-plate of our Engine, we drew up the cock, and prim'd the pan with dry Powder; then over both the weight and Piſtol we whelm'd a Receiver, capable of containing two Gallons of liquor, and having carefully cemented it on, we cauſed the Air to be diligently
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58466:25"/>pump'd out; having before put in a Mercurial Gage to help us to diſcern when it was exhauſted. Laſtly, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Pump to be plied in the mean while, for fear ſome Air ſhould ſteal in, before the tryal was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we did, by the motion of the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing key, ſhorten a ſtring that was tied both to it and the trigger of the Piſtol, by which means we did as much as we could towards the firing of the powder in the pan; but though the pan were made to fly open, yet the powder did not go off: whereupon letting in the Air, and cocking the Piſtol again without taking it off the weight it was tied to before, we drew out a little Air, to be ſure that the Receiver was cloſely cemented on, (which care we took in reference to another Experiment;) and then let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Air at the top of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſtopping it in with the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58466:26"/>key, we did, by the help of that key, draw aſide the trigger again; whereupon, though there had been no new Powder put into the Pan, nor any left in it, but only ſome little that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd after the late tryal; yet that little readily took fire and flaſh'd in the pan; which made it the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that in the former tryal ſparks of fire had been ſtruck out by the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſion of the Flint and Steel: which was the more credible, becauſe in an other tryal, made the ſame hour in the ſame exhauſted Receiver, two of the aſſiſtants plainly ſaw a ſpark or two fly out upon the falling of the Cock, though I, that chanced to ſtand in an inconvenient place, did not then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. But afterwards, having caus'd the Experiment for my fuller ſatisfaction to be repeated, I freed my ſelf from need of truſting others eyes: So that it appears, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58466:26"/>the great indiſpoſition of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder it ſelf to be reduced into flame in our <hi>Vacuum;</hi> yet even ſolid matter is not uncapable of being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited there, if it be put into a motion ſufficiently vehement.</p>
                           <p>If this Experiment had not been ſo very troubleſome to make, I ſhould have been invited to reiterate it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a not contemptible ſcruple may be prevented, if the tryal can be made to ſucceed, in regard that the going off of the whole Gunpowder, by the falling of a ſpark or two only upon two or three of its grains, would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that the accenſion of the reſt was made by the propagation of flame from the kindled grains to the reſt; ſo ſmall a portion of ignited and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly vaniſhing matter, as is to be found in a ſpark or two, being not likely to be able in ſo very ſhort a time to impart a Vehement, or ſo

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58466:27"/>time that the other Experiment of firing Gunpowder by the Sun-beams was made, we alſo made tryal of this; and that, as I remember, in the ſame Receiver, and with the ſame Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs. The event was; that, though the Air had been pump'd out, the concentrated beams of the Sun made the <hi>Aurum fulminans</hi> go off, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſcatter about the cavity of the Receiver a yellowiſh duſt or powder, which other tryals in the free Air made us look upon as particles of the Gold, that was the main ingredient of this odd compoſition.</p>
                           <p>This Experiment we reiterated a good while after in another place, and with other veſſels, and yet with the like ſucceſs.</p>
                           <p>But in regard theſe tryals being made by the united Sun-beams, 'twas unavoidable that our eyes would be before-hand affected with the vivid
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58466:28"/>impreſſions of ſo glaring a light; it ſeem'd not ſafe to determine, by the bare going off, or ſhattering of the <hi>Aurum fulminans,</hi> whether or no it afforded any flame or light upon its exploſion: For, as we could not be ſure of the affirmative, becauſe our eyes could not diſcern any momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany flame or flaſh; ſo it ſeem'd not ſafe to conclude the negative: ſince, though there had been ſuch a flame, yet, if it had not been ſtrong, it would not have been ſenſible to our eyes, whilſt preaffected by a powerful Light. Wherefore we reſolv'd to make this tryal in the night with an Iron heated, but not candent, (that its light might not eclipſe that which the powder might afford;) and having, after the manner already often recited, exhauſted a pretty large Receiver, and let down by a ſtring half a quarter of a grain (by weight) of good <hi>Aurum
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58466:28"/>fulminans</hi> of our own preparing, looſely tied in a little piece of thin pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (which paper, former tryals to another purpoſe kept us from fearing that no hotter an iron, than ours then was, would kindle,) we found, as we expected, that after the powder had lain long enough upon the iron to be throughly heated, it went off all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and, as the by-ſtanders af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, with a flaſh: but my face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accidentally turn'd to remove a Light that I feared might diſturb us, I could not ſee the flaſh my ſelf, and therefore caus'd the Experiment to be made once more, to ground my nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative upon my own obſervation: which quickly aſſur'd me, that the Luminous flaſh, produc'd upon the exploſion, was not only ſenſible, but conſiderable.</p>

                           <p>TO vary a little the foregoing Experiment, and try to ſave ſome moments of time, which on theſe occaſions is to be husbanded with the utmoſt care; having provided a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of iron, larger than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that it might by its bulk, being once heated, both contribute to the accenſion of the Sulphur, and to the laſting of its flame, we made a tryal, that I find regiſtred to this effect:</p>
                           <p>We took a pretty big lump of Brimſtone, and tied it to the turning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key; and having got what elſe was neceſſary in a readineſs, we caus'd the iron-plate to be haſtily brought
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58466:32"/>red-hot from the fire, and put upon a Pedeſtal, that the flame might be the more conſpicuous; and, having nimbly cemented on the Receiver, we ſpeedily let down the ſuſpended Brimſtone till it reſted upon the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot iron, by which being kindled, it ſent up a great flame with copious fumes, which hinder'd us not from plying the Pump, till we had, as we conjectur'd, emptied the Receiver; which we could not do without with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing together with the Air much ſulphureous ſmoak (that was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive enough both to the eyes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils.) But notwithſtanding this pumping out of the Air, though the flame did ſeem gradually to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what impair'd; yet it manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued burning much longer, than by the ſhort duration of other flames in our Receivers (when diligence is us'd to withdraw the Air from them) one
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58466:33"/>could have expected. And eſpecially one time, (for the experiment was made more than once) the flame laſted till the Receiver was judg'd to be well exhauſted; and ſome thought it did ſo ſurvive the exhauſtion, that it went not out ſo much for want of Air, as Fuel; the Brimſtone appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we took off the Receiver, either to have been conſum'd by the fire that fed on it, or to have caſually run off from the Iron, whoſe heat had kept it conſtantly melted.</p>
                           <p>☞ In caſe you ſhould have a mind to proſecute Experiments of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this and the precedent, it may not prove uſeleſs, if I intimate to you the following Advertiſements. 1. For the red-hot iron above mentioned we thought it not amiſs to provide, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the melting-pot imploy'd in the firſt experiment, a Pedeſtal (if I may ſo call it) made of a lump of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58466:33"/>dry'd Tobacco-pipe-clay, that the vehement heat of the iron might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fill the Receiver with the ſmoak of what it lean'd on, nor injure the Engine, if it ſhould reſt immediately upon that: And this Pedeſtal ſhould be ſo plac'd, that the iron may be as far, as you can, from the ſides of the Receiver, which elſe the exceſſive heat would indanger.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. To the above-mention'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave iron, that was to receive the Brimſtone, we did for ſome occaſions cauſe to be fitted a thick convex piece of iron, ſhap'd almoſt like a flattiſh Button; which was not to be us'd conſtantly, but upon occaſion, that, being laid red-hot over the melted Brimſtone, it might increaſe the heat, and keep the flame from having ſo broad a <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> whereby it would conſume its fuel too faſt.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. We ſometimes thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58466:34"/>for the clearer diſcerning of what ſhould happen in the Receiver, to make the experiment by night, and remove the Candles when we were juſt about to pump, preſuming that the flame would be conſpicuous enough by its own light; as indeed we found it to be, though its Light were but dimm, conſidering the greatneſs of the flame; whoſe colour, though it did not quite loſe its wonted blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, ſeem'd yet to have received a great and ſomewhat odd alteration.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. There is one great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſcarce avoidable in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, <hi>viz.</hi> that the fumes aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very copiouſly, do quickly much darken the Receiver, and (if the tryal be long continued) line it with a kind of flowre of Brimſtone, which obſcures it much more (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be carefully wip'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way whenſoever the Receiver is taken
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58466:34"/>off;) upon which account you will not, I preſume, wonder, if you ſhall find the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of theſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not always to be the very ſame with what you meet with in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: ſince, as 'tis very poſſible that we may not have been able to obſerve things ſo accurately by reaſon of the newly mention'd fumes and flowers; ſo 'tis not impoſſible, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (if there ſhall be any) of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens Obſervations from ours ſhould proceed from the ſame cauſe.</p>
                           <p>Before we paſs from this ſecond Experiment, it will not be amiſs to take notice, that though the flames of Brimſtone may be allow'd to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more durable than the flames of Vegetables are wont to be; yet 'tis not ſafe to conclude, that 'twas meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the account of their native vigour, that the flames above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd laſted ſo long in our Receiver.</p>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58466:35"/>
                           <p>For we ſeem'd to obſerve, that there was requiſite a very intenſe heat of the Iron to make the Sulphur capable of flaming on it, when any conſiderable proportion of Air was withdrawn. For which reaſon it ſeems expedient, according to what I lately intimated, that the Iron, that is to keep it melted, be of a good thickneſs, that it may the longer retain a competent heat; and we thought, it contributed to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulleſt tryals we made, that in them we us'd, beſides the concave iron, the convex one mention'd in the ſecond Note.</p>

                           <p>THoſe Sulphurs that Chymiſts call Metalline, being ſuppoſed by many to be of a much more fix'd nature than common Sulphur, and it being indeed probable enough, that in them good ſtore of very minute particles are crowded together, I thought fit to try, whether a body, wherein a vulgar Chymiſt would think the Sulphur of a metal to be the main ingredient, would afford in our <hi>Vacuum,</hi> a more vigorous or laſting flame than that of common Sulphur. And though I will not here trouble you with my particular ſcruples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Chymiſts doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58466:36"/>metalline Sulphurs, nor with the grounds on which I devis'd the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inflammable ſolution of <hi>Mars,</hi> (for I do not now give it a more deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate name) which ſome Chymiſts will not perhaps diſlike; I ſhall here annex the enſuing tranſcript of the Tryal it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>Having provided a ſaline Spirit, which by an uncommon way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was made exceeding ſharp and piercing, we put into a vial, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of containing three or four ounces of water, a convenient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of filings of Steel, which were not ſuch as are commonly ſold in ſhops to Chymiſts and Apothecaries, (thoſe being uſually not free enough from ruſt;) but ſuch as I had a while before caus'd to be purpoſely fil'd off from a piece of good ſteel. This metalline powder being moiſtn'd in the viol with a little of the menſtruum,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58466:36"/>was afterwards drench'd with more; whereupon the mixture grew very hot, and belch'd up copious and ſtinking fumes; which whether they conſiſted altogether of the vol tile ſulphur of the Mars, or of metalline ſteams participating of a ſulphureous nature, and join'd with the ſaline ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations of the menſtruum, is not neceſſary to be here diſcuſs'd. But whenceſoever this ſtinking ſmoak proceeded, ſo inflammable it was, that upon the approach of a lighted candle to it, it would readily enough take fire, and burn with a blewiſh and ſomewhat greeniſh flame at the mouth of the viol for a good while together; and that, though with little light, yet with more ſtrength than one would eaſily ſuſpect.</p>
                           <p>This flaming Viol therefore we conveigh'd into a Receiver, which he, who us'd to manage the Pump, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58466:37"/>that about ſix exſuctions would exhauſt. And the Receiver being well cemented on, upon the firſt ſuck the flame ſuddenly appear'd four or five times as great as before; which I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to this, That, upon the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the Air, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the weakning of its preſſure, great ſtore of bubbles were produc'd in the menſtruum, which breaking could not but ſupply the neck of the Viol with ſtore of inflammable ſteams, which (as we thought) took not fire without ſome noiſe; upon the ſecond exſucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air the flame blaz'd out as before, and ſo it likewiſe did upon the third exſuction, but after that it went out; nor could we re-kindle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fire by haſtily removing the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; only we found, that there remained ſuch a diſpoſition in the ſmoak to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammability, that holding a lighted candle to it, a flame was quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled.</p>

                           <p>BEcauſe it may, upon grounds not improbable, be thought, that well-dephlegm'd Spirit of Wine being a pure Aethereal liquor, which does not, like combuſtible Sulphurs (whether vulgar or metalline) emit any viſible ſmoak to ſtifle the flame (into which it may in the free air be totally reſolved;) if this ſpirituous and thus qualified liquor could be duly aſſociated with a metalline body, the reſulting flame might be more than ordinarily vigorous and durable; I reſolv'd to make an Experiment of this ſort, and having by a way, that

                           <p>THe better to examine the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Air to Flame, I thought fit not only to make the ſeveral Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als mention'd in this Paper, whether it would live in a <hi>medium</hi> much thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than <hi>Air;</hi> but alſo to try, whether
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58466:40"/>it would be able to continue in a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> many hundred times thicker than Air, namely in <hi>Water.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I doubted not but many would think this both an eaſie and a needleſs Inquiry, ſince eminent Writers, both Ancient and Modern, tell us without ſcruple, that <hi>Naptha</hi> and <hi>Camphire</hi> will burn under Water; but I had never the good fortune to be able to make them do ſo; and may be allowed to doubt, whether theſe Writers; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their confidence, deliver what they affirm upon Experience, not bare Tradition. And though in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Authors I have met with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Receipts of making Compoſitions that will not only burn under water, but be kindled by it; yet I have found thoſe, I had occaſion to conſider, to be ſo lamely or ſo darkly (and ſome of them I fear ſo falſly) ſet down, that by the following compoſition, how
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58466:40"/>ſlight ſoever it may ſeem, I have been able to do more than with things they ſpeak very promiſingly of; ſince, though 'twill not be kindled <hi>by</hi> water, yet being once kindled it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to burn <hi>under</hi> water.</p>
                           <p>And that there might be no ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that whilſt the mixture conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued under water, it did only as it were vehemently ferment, or ſuffer a violent agitation of its parts without having them kindled, till in their aſcending they were actually fired by the contact of the air, incumbent on the ſurface of the water; To obviate this ſuſpicion (I ſay) we were careful to try the Experiment, not only in other Veſſels, but in a large Glaſs, the tranſparency of whoſe ſides, as well as that of the contained water, would permit us to ſee for a while the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our compoſition, which was ſometimes with a weight detain'd, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58466:41"/>ſometimes with a <hi>Forceps</hi> held, till 'twas conſumed, a good way under the ſurface of the Water.</p>
                           <p>The way of making the Experiment is this: We took of Gunpowder three ounces, of well burnt Charcoal one drachm, of good Sulphur or flower of Brimſtone a little leſs than half a drachm, of choice Salt-petre near a drachm and half: Which Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents being well reduc'd to powder, and diligently mingled without any liquor; <hi>either</hi> a large Gooſe-quil, whoſe feathery part was cut off, <hi>or</hi> a piece of a Tobacco-pipe of two or three inches long, and well ſtop'd at one end, had its cavity well fill'd with this mixture, (inſtead of which, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Gunpowder alone might ſerve, if it did not operate too violently, or waſte too ſoon:) For the kindling whereof, the open orifice of the Quil or Pipe was carefully ſtopt with a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58466:41"/>convenient quantity of the ſame mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made up with as little Chymical Oyle or Water, as would bring it to a fit conſiſtence. This Wild-fire was kindled in the Air, and the Quill or Pipe, together with a weight, to which 'twas tied to keep it from aſcending, was ſlowly let down to a convenient depth under water, where it would continue to burn, as appeared by the great ſmoak it emitted, and other ſigns, as it did in the air; becauſe the ſhape of the Quil or Pipe kept the dry mixture from being acceſſible to the water (that would have diſorder'd and ſpoil'd it) at any other part than the upper Orifice; and there the ſtream of kindled matter iſſued out with ſuch violence, as did inceſſantly beat off the neighbouring water, and kept it from entering into the cavity that contain'd the mixture, which therefore would continue burning till 'twas conſumed.</p>
                           <pb n="76" facs="tcp:58466:42"/>
                           <p>'Tis probable, that moſt men will conclude from this Experiment, that Air is not ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the duration of Flame, as ſome other of our Tryals ſeem to argue; and that there ought to be a difference made between ordinary Flames, and thoſe that burn with an extraordinary ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency. But my deſign being, as I long ſince intimated, rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Tryals than debate Hypotheſes, I ſhall only add, that it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on the behalf of the opinion that this experiment ſeems to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, that, not to mention the Air that may lurk in the Pores of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or that which may be intercepted between the little grains of Powder whereof the mixture conſiſts, the Salt-petre it ſelf may be ſuppos'd to be of ſuch a texture, that in its very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the corpuſcles, that compoſe it, may intercept ſtore of little aereal
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58466:42"/>particles between the very minute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid ones which thoſe Corpuſcles are made up of. And this inexiſtence of the Air in Nitre may be probably ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from the great windineſs of the flame that is produced upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of Nitre. According to this ſurmiſe, though our mixture burns under water, yet it does not burn without air, being ſupplied with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſerve the turn by the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eruptions of the aereal particles of the diſſipated Nitre it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>On this occaſion I remember, that in another Paper I relate, that for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers purpoſes, and among them to remove this ſuſpicion, I ſucceſsfully tried to reproduce Nitre in <hi>Vacuo Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liano,</hi> that there might not be any Air, or at leaſt any quantity worth heeding, intercepted between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening particles, that by their coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions made up the nitrous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58466:43"/>which in favour of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Air to Flame may be pretended to be but ſo many little empty bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles cloſe ſtop'd, whoſe moiſter parts may be the fire that kindles the nitre be exceedingly rarified, and in that eſtate emulate air, and violently burſt their little priſons, and throw about the fragments of them with force, and in numbers enough to make their ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate appear ſuch a flame, as is wont to be made by unctuous and truly combuſtible Bodies; and yet this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd ſubſtance, that thus ſhatters the nitrous particles, may really be no true and laſting air, but only vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently agitated vapours, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, upon the ceſſation of the hear, return to liquor; as we ſee, that the vapours of an Aeolipile, that iſſue out after the aereal Particles have been expell'd, <hi>though</hi> they make a great noiſe and a temporary wind near the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58466:43"/>hole they ſtream. out at, and would perhaps, if that hole were cloſe ſtopt, break the Aeolipile; <hi>yet</hi> are not true and permanent Air, but at a ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance off the Inſtrument return into water.</p>
                           <p>But though I could ſuggeſt other ſuſpicions and conjectures about the incluſion of Air between the particles of Salt-petre; yet I forbear to mention them in a Writing deſign'd to be chiefly Hiſtorical.</p>

But whilſt we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what was to be done on this occaſion, and had not yet let in the Air that had been pump'd out, the lights alſo continuing yet removed; we were ſurpriz'd to ſee ſomething burn like a pale blewiſh Flame almoſt in the midſt of the cavity of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and at firſt ſuſpected it to be ſome illuſion of the eyes; but all the by-ſtanders perceiving it alike, and obſerving that it grew very broad, we look'd at it with great attention, and found it to laſt much longer, than, I remember, I have ſeen any flame do
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58466:44"/>in an Exhauſted Receiver. I ſhould have ſuſpected, it had proceeded from ſome Brimſtone, ſticking, without our heeding it, to ſome part of the iron, which we had formerly imployed to kindle Sulphur in our Receiver, had it not been that, beſides other things, I remembred, that we had juſt before kept it red-hot in the fire, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt have burn'd away any little Brimſtone, if there were any that adher'd to it: But though we much wonder'd, whence this our Flame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, I would not let any thing be done that might haſten its extinction; and at length, when it expired of it ſelf, we let in the Air, which had been till then kept out, and perceiv'd upon the concave part of the iron (which we judg'd to be the place where the flame had appeared) a piece of melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed metal, which we concluded had been faſten'd to the ſtring, that the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58466:45"/>fewel we deſign'd to kindle had been tied to, in order to the letting it down the more eaſily: And this made us conceive, that the ſtring happening to be burn'd by the exceſſive heat of the iron, the piece of metal fell into the cavity of it, and, by the ſame heat, the more combuſtible part, which the Chymiſts call the Sulphur, was melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept on fire, and continued burning ſo long as we have related. The piece of metal was judg'd to be Lead, but having not formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſuch a diſpoſition in that metal to be inflam'd, I conſider'd it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and perceived, that 'twas ſome Fragment, that the Operator had chanced to light on, of a mixture of Lead and Tin that I had (a while before, for an Experiment not at all belonging to our preſent ſubject) cauſed to be colliquated in a certain proportion. Upon whoſe account
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58466:45"/>it ſeems, the mixture of the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had acquired ſuch a new texture, as, whether by making the bodies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen one another, or by what other means ſoever, fitted the maſs to afford us the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> above recited. And though I made an unſucceſsful Tryal with a mixture of Lead and Tin to produce ſuch a flame upon the heated Iron in the open Air; yet the newly related experiment may ſuffice to argue, that there may be Flames of metalline Sulphurs (as the Chymiſts call them) that will be at leaſt as eaſily produced without the concurrence of the Air, as that of common Sulphur, and continue to burn in our <hi>Vacuum</hi> longer than it.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58466:49"/>upon the hot iron a piece of ſuch brimſtone, as would, in ſpite of ſo diſadvantagious a place, be kindled with that heat.

But our Sulphur, melting with the heat of the iron <hi>Cylinder,</hi> dropt unluckily from the ſtring 'twas faſten'd to before, and for the moſt part fell off. And as ſoon as it came to the ground, where it was diſtant from the vehement heat of the metal, the flame expired, and that part of the Sulphur, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to ſtick to the ſide of the iron, was inflam'd by it: And I, that chanc'd to be then in an inconvenient poſture for ſeeing the Camphire, could not, becauſe of the ſmoak of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd Brimſtone, well diſcern
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58466:50"/>what became of it.

Which ſeem'd the leſs to be doubted of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Camphire was by help of the turning Key let down low enough, and if it had afforded a flame, the difference of Colours betwixt that and the blew flame of Sulphur would have made it very eaſie for me to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd them.</p>

How far a tryal of this nature may be made in our Engine, the following Narratives will beſt declare.</p>
                           <p>We took ſome Paper, and laying it upon ſome convenient part of the plate of the Engine, we made upon it a train of dry Powder as long as the glaſs would well cover; then, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully faſtening on the Receiver with good Cement, we ſolicitouſly pump'd out the Air; which done, we took a good Burning-glaſs, and about noon caſt the Sun-beams through it upon the train of ſome Gunpowder:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58466:52"/>where, though the indiſpoſition to accenſion was ſo great, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der did not only ſmoak but melt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going off, and the <hi>Operator</hi> (though vers'd in ſuch Experiments) would not allow that it would ſignifie any thing to continue the tryal any longer; yet upon my being obſtinate to proſecute it, he, being willing to follow the Experiment, rationally conſider'd, that the Receiver, we had been hitherto fain to uſe, was ſo opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous as to reſiſt the entrance of many of the beams that ſhould have their operation upon the Powder: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon taking a finer glaſs that was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come in, we laid by the former, and imploy'd that, which, by reaſon of its tranſparency, ſo little weaken'd the beams of the Sun, that being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my direction held <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi> upon the ſame parts of the train, they were able to fire ſeveral of them
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58466:52"/>one after another. But though the Sun could thus kindle the Powder, yet it could not make the flame propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, but only thoſe parts that were melted did at length kindle and fly away, leaving the reſt unalter'd, as I curiouſly obſerv'd, finding ſeveral little maſſes of colliquated matter in ſeveral places of the train, with the Powder unchang'd in all the other parts of the ſame train that lay in a direct line; beſides that ſome of the little colliquated maſſes were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the reſt of the Powder, which appear'd unchang'd, and kindled rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and flaſh'd all away as ſoon as I caus'd the Burning-glaſs to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to it in the open Air.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58466:53"/>of a convenient bigneſs, whence we pump'd out the Air after the uſual manner, and perhaps with more than uſual diligence. But though at length, after the Powder had long reſiſted the beams of the Sun concentrated on it by a good double convex Burning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, it did, as I expected, take fire at the Touch-hole, and fill the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with ſmoak; yet this kindled Powder could not propagate the flame to that which was in the box, how contiguous ſoever the two parcels were to one another. And when the inſtrument was taken out into the Air, (by which it appear'd how free the Touch-hole was,) as ſoon as ever new-priming with the ſame ſort of Powder was put to it, the whole very readily went off: And when, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction, we caus'd the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be new charg'd, and upon its taking fire only at the Touch-hole in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58466:54"/>the exhauſted Receiver, we ordered new-priming to be added without ſo much as taking the inſtrument out of the Receiver, though afterwards the Receiver was cloſed again, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being exhauſted of Air; the Powder, though cloſely ſhut up in the Glaſs, did readily go off, as well that which was in the box or cavity of the Powder-tryer, as that which lay on the outward part of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                           <p>YOu will eaſily believe, that the event of the foregoing tryals ſeem'd ſtrange enough to the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious perſons, that I had deſir'd to be preſent at them; and perhaps the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive conſideration of it may well enough ſuggeſt ſuch odd ſuſpicions and conjectures, as I have neither the leiſure nor the boldneſs to diſcourſe of in this place.</p>
                           <p>But here I ſhall not diſſemble my having, by a ſomewhat differing way, made a couple of tryals, whereof though the firſt may confirm the great indiſpoſition of Gunpowder to be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58466:55"/>kindled in our <hi>Vacuum,</hi> yet the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſeems to look another way.</p>
                           <p>The firſt is ſummarily ſet down in my Notes to this purpoſe. [A few ſmall corns of Gunpowder, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a very ſmall buble freed from its Air, and ſecur'd againſt the return of it, or any other, and then apply'd warily to Coals cover'd with Aſhes; did not go off nor burn, but afforded a little yellow powder that ſeem'd to be Sulphur, and ſublim'd to the upper part of the glaſs.]</p>
                           <p>The Latter's event I found in the ſame paper to have been thus regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd. [But two larger Bubles though ſtrong, whereof one had the Air but in <hi>part,</hi> and the other <hi>carefully</hi> emptied; being provided each of them with a greater quantity of Powder (though ſcarce enough to promiſe ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) a while after they were put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quick Coals, each of them was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58466:55"/>blown in pieces with a Report almoſt like that of a Musket; but, though this was done in a dark place, yet we did not perceive, whether or no there were any real flame produc'd.]</p>
                           <p>The event of this Tryal ſeems at firſt ſight to contradict the inference, that probably you have drawn from the foregoing Experiments. But yet it may not be unworthy of our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whether this way of tryal be as proper to give ſatisfaction to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as that, made with the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, was. And I leave it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, whether or no it may not be doubted, whether the going off of the Gunpowder was caus'd by a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, though extreamly ſwift, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of real Flame, from the firſt kindled grains to the reſt; or did not proceed from this, That the coals acting ſtrongly at the ſame time on the whole <hi>Area</hi> or extent of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58466:56"/>that was next to them, and this in the abſence of the Air, each grain was in that caſe, as 'twere, a little <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado,</hi> and the heap of them being uniformly enough acted on by the fire, they were made to go off, as to ſenſe, all at once, as if there had been but a contemporary Exploſion made of them all together by the action of the external fire, rather than any true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion made by the flaming grains of the unkindled ones. As I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I have tried, that even in the open air one may, with a Burning-glaſs dextrouſly imploy'd, make ſome part of a little parcel of <hi>Aurum fulminans</hi> go off, whilſt the neighbouring parts of the ſame parcel, to which the <hi>focus</hi> does not extend with heat enough, will not be made to do ſo.</p>

                     <p>We alſo provided a tall Glaſs-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, which was in length 18 inches, and contain'd above twenty pints of water. This Receiver, which was open at both ends, was at the upper orifice (which was not wide) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

                     <p>Theſe things being thus prepared, we took the ſmall Glaſs-lamp above mentioned, and having lighted it, we plac'd both it and a ſmall Bird (which was a Green-finch) upon the Braſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, and in a trice faſtned it to the lower orifice of the Receiver, and then watched the event; which was, that within two minutes (as near as we

                     <p>After he had for a pretty while, by being kept in the free Air, recovered and refreſhed himſelf, the former tryal was repeated again, and at the end of the ſecond minute the flame of the Lamp went out; but the Bird ſeem'd not to be endanger'd by being kept there a while longer.</p>
                     <p>After this, we put in together with the ſame Bird two lighted Lamps at once, (<hi>viz.</hi> the former and another like it) whoſe flames, according to

                     <p>In the tall Receiver above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned we included a Mouſe, with a lighted Lamp filled with the Spirit of Wine; but before the Experiment was near finiſh'd, the Mouſe, being at liberty within the Glaſs, made a ſhift to blow out the flame; which being revived without taking out either the Lamp or the Animal, the Spirit of Wine burn'd about a minute longer, during which time the Mouſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd not to be grown ſick, no more than it did afterwards, when for ſome minutes, after the extinction of the flame, he had been kept in the ſame cloſe and infected Air.</p>

The Experiment we repeated with a piece of the fore-mention'd Taper, and the ſame Bird, which, though caſt into threatning ſymptoms upon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual withdrawing of the Air, outlived not only the Flame, but the ſmoak too that iſſued from the kindled Wieck; which circumſtance was alſo obſerved in the preceding Tryal.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, having freed the Receiver from ſmoak, and ſupplyed it with freſh air, we put in with the ſame Bird a piece of Charcoal of about two inches in length, and half an inch in breadth, which had been, juſt before 'twas put in, well blown with a pair of Bellows, that it might be freed from aſhes, and thorowly kindled; and made haſte to pump out the air. This diligence was continued not only till none of the fire could be diſcern'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58466:62"/>by any of the By-ſtanders, but till, in our eſtimation, (which the event juſtified) it was irrecoverable by the admiſſion of the outward air; which at its coming in found the Bird very ſick indeed, but yet capable of a very quick Recovery. And this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment was, with the ſame Animal and Coal re-kindled, tried over again with the ſame ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Whether this ſurvival of Animals, not only to a flame that emits ſtore of fuliginous ſteams, as in this tryal; but to that which is made of ſo pure a fuel as Spirit of Wine, that affords not ſuch ſteams (as in the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment;) <hi>Whether,</hi> I ſay, this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival proceed from this, That the Common flame and the Vital flame are maintained by diſtinct ſubſtances or parts of the Air; <hi>or</hi> that common Flame making a great waſte of the Aereal ſubſtance, they both need to

                     <p>We took two <hi>Glo-worms,</hi> that ſhone vividly enough, eſpecially one of them, whoſe Light appear'd ſtrong and tincted as if it had been tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through a blew Glaſs: Theſe we laid upon a little plate, which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a ſmall Receiver of finer glaſs than ordinary, that we might the better ſee what would happen: And having for the ſame purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Candles, that no other Light might obſcure that of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, we waited in the dark till that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58466:64"/>was conſpicuous, and then order'd the Air to be begun to be pump'd out; and, as we expected, upon the very firſt exſuction there began to be a very manifeſt diminution of the Light, which grew dimmer and dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as the Air was more and more withdrawn, till at length it quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, though there were young Eyes among the aſſiſtants.

This experiment was repeated with one more of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects; and the event was, that they all three gradually loſt their Light by the Exhauſtion of the Receiver, and regain'd it (with ſome increaſe, as was judged) by the return of the Air. And in this Experiment we let
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58466:64"/>in the Air by degrees, and with an interval or two, to obſerve, as we did, that, as the diminution of Light was greater and greater when the Air was more and more withdrawn, ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning ſplendor was gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd as we pleas'd to let in more and more Air upon the worms.</p>

But being unwilling to abandon the Experiment till we tryed it yet further, I caus'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver to be exhauſted yet once or twice more, and at length I perceived, that the Light began to diminiſh, as the Air was withdrawn; and laſt of all it ſo diſppear'd that the by-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders could not ſee it, whereas upon the readmiſſion of the Air the Light ſhone vividly as before, if not more bright. This Experiment was rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated with the like ſucceſs, and in both theſe times the like happened to the Light of the dead one and of a living one that we included with it, to be able to compare them together; though there were this diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58466:67"/>them, that the luminous part of the dead worm was much larger than that of the living, and the Light of the later appear'd of a very greeniſh blew, whereas that of the former ſeem'd to be of a white yellow.</p>

                     <p>'TIs a receiv'd Tradition, that bodies when dead are much heavier than the ſame were when alive; the matter of fact being taken for granted, ſome will perhaps aſcribe the change to the utter inability of a dead body any way to aſſiſt thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to remove it. But, according to the general opinion, this difference proceeds from the total extinction or
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58466:68"/>receſs of the ſpirits vital and animal, which being ſuppos'd to be not only agil but light, leſſen'd the weight of the body they enliven'd; and Flame being conceiv'd to be the lighteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong bodies here below, 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that ſome will aſcribe the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> to the levity of the Flame, which by being diffus'd through the body of an Animal, and vivifying it, deſerves the name of Vital. But I would not adviſe any to rely on this conceit, till they are duly ſatisfied of the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, which becauſe I have not yet found that any has endeavour'd to try, I ſhall on this occaſion give you the following tranſcript of one of my Notes about Statical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Mouſe</hi> weighing about three drachms and a half, being put in one of the ſcales of a very nice ballance,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58466:68"/>was counterpois'd together with a ſtring that was tied about his neck like a nooſe, and after a while by drawing the ends of it was there ſtrangled. As ſoon as we judg'd him quite dead, we weigh'd him again, and though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſeen to fall from him; yet, contrary to the receiv'd Tradition, that Bodies are much heavier dead than alive, we found the weight to have loſt about 7/16 of a grain; which probably proceeded from the avola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divers ſubtil particles upon his violent and convulſive ſtruglings with death. But this was no more than an Experiment of this kind, made ſome years ago, induc'd me to expect and foretell.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards in a larger Ballance, but a very good one, purpoſely made for nice Experiments, we took a very young Catlin, of between 10. and 11. ounces in weight, and caus'd him to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58466:69"/>be ſtrangled on the ſame ſcale, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had been put. But he could not be diſpatch'd ſo ſoon as an ordinary full grown animal; ſo that by that time he was quite dead, we found him not only not to be grown heavier but lighter by four grains; which did not much ſurprize us, having elſewhere noted the life of ſo very young Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of that kind not to be eaſily deſtroy'd for want of Reſpiration. And I remember, that, for tryals ſake, another Catlin of the ſame Litter with this I have mention'd, being inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a Receiver, wherein another Animal of that ſize might probably have been diſpatch'd in two or three minutes, by the pumping out of Air, was kept there ſomewhat above a quarter of an hour before he appear'd to be quite dead.</p>

For, it ſeems likely to prove no inconſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery in reference to the lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58466:71"/>
                     <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> if it be found, that the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> in Seminal rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments needs, as well as other <hi>Flames,</hi> the concurrence of the Air to actuate it.</p>
                  <p>I thought fit therefore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great and almoſt inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable difficulties, which 'twas eaſie enough for me to foreſee I ſhould meet with, to attempt the hatching of Eggs in our <hi>Vacuum;</hi> but though I made ſome unſucceſsful tryals of this kind in order to a diſcovery about Reſpiration, (not here to ſpeak of the attempts I made about the animation of <hi>putrid</hi> matter,) yet leaving the mention of them to its proper place, I ſhall only take notice in this what directly concerns the preſent inquiry. Conſidering then that pregnant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males cannot be made to live and bring forth young in our exhauſted Receiver, and that the Eggs of Birds
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58466:71"/>and ſuch greater animals do in this colder climate of ours require to be hatched by the incubation of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males (or other Birds;) I thought the fitteſt ſubjects, I could both make choice of and procure for the deſign'd Experiments, would be the <hi>Eggs</hi> of <hi>Silk-worms:</hi> For, having many years ſince tried ſeveral things about thoſe Inſects, and among others found, that their Eggs would be hatched, not only by the heat of ones body, though that be the uſual way, but by the warmth of the Sun even here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if they be kept till the Spring be far enough advanc'd: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring this (I ſay) I got a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Silk-worms Eggs; and having caus'd three conveniently ſhap'd, but very ſmall, Receivers, to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made, that differ'd very little (and that accidentally) either in ſize or figure, we conveyed into each
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58466:72"/>of them, together with a ſmall ſtock of Mulberry-leaves, ſuch a number of Eggs as we thought ſufficient to make one morally ſecure, that at leaſt ſome of them were prolifick; this done, we carefully exhauſted one of them, and ſecur'd it againſt the return of the Air; the two others we left full of Air: But having left in one, a little hole for the Air to come in and get out at, we ſtop'd the other ſo cloſe, as to hinder all intercourſe between the included Air and the External. All things being thus pnepared, we expos'd the Receivers to a South-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where they might lie quiet, and where I either came, or ſent to look on them from time to time; the ſpring being then ſo far advanc'd, that I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the heat of the Sun would be of it ſelf ſufficient to hatch them in no long time.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:58466:72"/>
                  <p>As to the ſucceſs of this tryal, my not being able to find any regiſter of the particular <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd, keeps me from venturing to relate it very circumſtantially; but this I remember in general, that both I and others took notice, that in the unexhauſted Receivers there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Eggs hatch'd into little Inſects that perforated their ſhells, and crept out of them; though afterwards for want of change of Food, or Air, or both, few or none of them proved long-liv'd. But though the Eggs in <hi>theſe</hi> Receivers began to afford us lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle animals in a few dayes; yet the Eggs in the <hi>exhauſted</hi> Receiver did not, in many more, afford us any. And though I will not venture to ſay how long preciſely we kept them in the ſame window, after ſome of the above-mention'd Eggs were hatched; yet (if I much miſtake not) 'twas
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58466:73"/>(from firſt to laſt) about three or four times as long; and I remember, we kept them till it was thought to no purpoſe to wait any longer, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in imputing the not hatching of the Eggs by the ſo long continued action of the Sun to the abſence of the Air.</p>
                  <p>What other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> occurr'd to us in making this Experiment, and another not unproſperous one upon the Eggs of Flyes, you may expect, when I can light on my Notes about them, or have my memory refreſh'd by thoſe that aſſiſted at the making of them.</p>

                     <p>I Elſewhere mention that it has been obſerv'd, by a couple of our <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi</hi> (whom I there name,) and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times by Me, that (here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) multitudes of Gnats are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of little animals that live, for a part of the Summer, like Fiſhes in the water; and conſidering, that by theſe a very unuſual paſſage is made from <hi>Swimming</hi> to <hi>Flying</hi> animals, I thought them very fit ſubjects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>[Partly</hi> to try whether at leaſt an <hi>animal</hi> already living and moving in our <hi>Vacuum</hi> may be able to attain the perfection due to it according to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58466:74"/>the courſe of Nature; and <hi>partly</hi> to examine, whether, in caſe he ſhould attain it, at leaſt the lighter ſort of winged Inſects may be able to fly in that place; and <hi>partly</hi> to diſcover, whether an animal, that had long liv'd in our <hi>Vacuum,</hi> would, when turn'd to a Flie, be able to continue alive without a Reſpiration, he had never been accuſtom'd to, in its priſtine form or ſtate; we took divers of thoſe little ſwimming Creatures, which, in Autumn, eſpecially towards the end of it, are wont to be turn'd into Gnats, and having put a convenient number of them together in a fit quantity of Rain-water, wherein they had been found and kept, into a ſmall Receiver, the Air was pumpt out, and the veſſel ſecur'd againſt its return, and then ſet aſide in a place, where I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the day after ſome of theſe little animals were yet alive and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58466:74"/>ſwimming to and fro, not without minute bubles adhering to them; but at the end of a day or two after that, I could not perceive any of them to ſurvive their dead Companions, nor did any of them recover, when freſh Air was let in upon them. But though this Experiment were the beſt I was then able to make, yet I reſolv'd, if God ſhould vouchſafe me life and health, to repeat it the enſuing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; that, wherein it was made, proving ſo cold and unſeaſonable, that a number of theſe little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, put up with water into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſmall Receiver, died all within a few days, though none of the Air was exhauſted; and ſeveral, that I kept in an ordinary Glaſs, that was divers times unſtop'd to give them freſh air, did yet periſh at no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rate. And I confeſs (as unkind as this trouble of mine may ſeem to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58466:75"/>the Air;) that the failing of this and ſome other Experiments of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Animals in our exhauſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers was the more unwelcome to me, becauſe I had and have ſtill a great deſire to ſee, if it be poſſible, what would happen to Animals, which had been produc'd in a place free from the preſſure of the Atmoſphere, as if they had been born in <hi>Epicurus's</hi> imaginary <hi>intermundane</hi> ſpaces, upon their coming to be ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with our heavy Air, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their tenderly fram'd bodies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to its immediate preſſure.</p>

                     <p>WE took Spirit of Nitre, ſo ſtrong, that the fumes made the upper part of the Glaſs, it was kept in, always reddiſh, and having put but one ounce of it into a bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with a long neck, capable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as we gueſs'd, twelve or ſixteen times as much, we caus'd an equal weight of <hi>Alkhool</hi> (or highly rectified Spirit of Wine) to be taken, and a little of it being put to the Spirit of Nitre, it preſently made ſo ſtrong
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58466:78"/>and quick an expanſion or exploſion, that ſome of it flew out of the Glaſs and hit againſt the cieling of the room, (where I ſaw the mark of it,) and falling upon his face that held the Glaſs, made him think (as he told me) that fire had fallen upon it, and made him run down the ſtairs like a mad man to quench the heat at the Pump. Wherefore bidding the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borant proceed more warily, I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to put into the Bolt-head but part of a ſpoonful of Spirit of Wine at a time; and yet at each of a pretty many affuſions, that I ſtay'd to ſee the effect of, there would be a great noiſe, as of an ebuilition, though no ſtore of froth produc'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo great a heat that I could not hold the Glaſs in my hand; and immediately there would iſſue out a copious and red ſmoak; to which when I caus'd a little Candle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58466:78"/>to be held, though at near half a foot diſtance from the top of the bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, it would preſently take fire, and burn at the top of the bolt-head like a flame at the upper end of a Candle, till I caus'd it to be blown out, that freſh Spirit of Wine might be pour'd in; which when it was all mingled with the other liquor, the heat and conflict cauſed.</p>

                     <head>EXPER. III. <hi>About an Exploſion made by two Bodies actually</hi> Cold.</head>
                     <p>I Remember not, that I found the Aſſertors of Exploſions in Animals to have taken notice of a difficulty, which to me ſeems not uneaſie to be obſerv'd, and yet very worthy to be cleared. For 'tis known, that Fiſhes, and thoſe eſpecially of the vaſter ſort, can move and act in the waters with a ſtupendious force; and yet it is affirm'd by thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know it, that the Blood of moſt Fiſhes is ſtill actually cold:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58466:81"/>And I remember, I found the blood even of thoſe I diſſected alive, to be ſo. From whence moſt men would argue, that even in the vaſt Sea-monſters, there can be made no Exploſions, theſe being ſtill effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by or accompanied with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe degree of heat.</p>
                     <p>'Twere incongruous to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to examine this difficulty as it directly regards the Exploſions, ſaid to be made in Animals: But ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Exploſions in general, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might do the favourers of <hi>vital</hi> ones (if I may ſo term them) no unacceptable piece of ſervice, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally ſhewing, that 'tis not impoſſible, though it ſeem very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that Exploſions ſhould be made upon the mixture of bodies, which, whilſt they ſeem to put one another into a ſtate of Efferveſcence,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58466:82"/>are really cold, nay colder than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their being mingled. Of theſe odd kind of mixtures, I remember I have in another
<note n="*" place="margin">About the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or Extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Air.</note> paper ſet down ſome Tryals that I made to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as well with two liquors as with a liquor and a ſolid body; which later ſort I there mention my having made by an improvement of an experiment of the excellent <hi>Florentine Virtuoſi.</hi> And among thoſe Tryals I find one, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency to the matter in hand invites me to annex as much of it as is proper in this place.</p>
                     <p>There were put two ounces of powder'd <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> into a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty large Glaſs-tube Hermetically ſeal'd at one end; into the ſame a ſlender Glaſs-pipe, furniſhed with two ounces of <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58466:82"/>ſo put, that, when we pleas'd, we could make the liquor run out into the larger Tube, which, after theſe things were done, was clos'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, ſo that nothing might get in or out. My deſign was, that this inſtrument ſhould be ſo warily inverted, that the <hi>Operator</hi> might get out of the way, and the Oyl of Vitriol, falling ſlowly upon the Sal Armoniac, ſhould, without produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any heat, produce an explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not dangerous to the By-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But whilſt I was withdrawn to a neighbouring place to write a Letter, the Operator not ſtaying for particular directions, raſhly inverted the inſtrument without taking care to get away: whence it happen'd, that as ſoon as ever the contained liquor, being too plentifully poured out, came to work on the Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58466:83"/>wherewith it is wont to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce cold, there was ſo ſurprizing and vehement an Expanſion or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion made, that with a great noiſe, (which, as the Laborant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, much exceeded the report of a Piſtol,) the Glaſſes were broken into a multitude of pieces, many of which I ſaw preſently after, and a pretty deal of the mixture was thrown up with violence againſt the Operators Doublet and his Hat, which it ſtruck, off, and his face; eſpecially about his eyes, where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately were produc'd extreamly painful tumors, which might alſo have been very dangerous, had I not come timely in, and (to add that upon the by) made him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſſolve ſome <hi>Saccharum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turni</hi> in fair water, and with a ſoft ſpunge keep it conſtantly moiſten'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58466:83"/>by very frequently renewed appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Liquor: By Gods bleſſing upon which means, within an hour or two, the pain, that had been ſo raging, was taken away, and the fretting Oyl of Vitriol was kept from ſo much as breaking the skin of the Tumors that it had made.</p>
                     <p>The firſt part of the Relation of this tryal might have been omitted, or at leaſt ſhorten'd, unleſs I had deſign'd to communicate unto you a way of doing what I do not know to have been attempted by others, namely to put bodies together when and by what degrees one pleaſes, after the Glaſs that contains them has been Hermetically ſeal'd up; which Mechanical contrivance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially as it may be varied, may be, as I have try'd, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58466:84"/>apply'd to more purpoſes than 'twere proper here to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude with a word or two touching the foregoing Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; I ſhall only add, That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time we made a like tryal a ſafer way, by tying a Bladder ſo to the top of a Bolt-head, into which we had before-hand put the <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> that, by warily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Bladder, whence the Air had been expreſs'd, we could make ſome of the <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> we had lodg'd in its folds, to fall upon the liquor, with which it preſently made an Exploſive mixture, that quickly blew up the Bladder.</p>

                  <p>WHen I determin'd to write this Polemical Diſcourſe, I did not forget, that when I firſt ventur'd ſome of my triſles abroad into the world, my friends obtain'd from me a promiſe that, after I ſhould have anſwer'd, the two firſt that ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly write againſt me (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be the Learned <hi>Linus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi>) to ſhew that I was not altogether unacquainted with a way of defending Truths, I would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards write no Book in anſwer to any, that ſhould come forth againſt mine; for, not only my friends, but I, thought it enough for a perſon that never was a Gown-man, to communicate freely
<pb facs="tcp:58466:87"/>his thoughts and Experiments to the Curious, without deſpairing, that thoſe things, that ſhould be evidently true, would be able to make their own way, and ſuch as were very probable would meet with Patrons and Defenders, in ſo inquiſitive an age as ours. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I do not find, that either upon the account of my Writings, or Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious mens opinion of them, I have had much cauſe to repent the keeping of my promiſe, notwithſtanding the Writings, that have impugn'd ſome of mine, but without much prejudice, that I know of, either to the propos'd Truths, or the Propoſer of them.

But yet this Conſideration would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have engaged me to write the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Preface, if the Objections I was to anſwer had not been, by a Perſon of ſo much Fame, propos'd, with ſo much confidence; and though with
<pb facs="tcp:58466:88"/>very great Civility to me, yet with ſuch endeavours to make my Opinions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not only untrue, but irrational and abſurd, that I fear'd his diſcourſe, if unanſwer'd, might paſs for unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, eſpecially among thoſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, who, not being vers'd in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtaticks, would be apt to take his Authority and his Confidence for cogent Arguments; and who (not obſerving how liberal ſome men are of titles to the Arguments that pleaſe them) would make a ſcruple of thinking, that what is with great ſolemnity deliver'd for a Demonſtration in a Book of Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, can be other than a Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Demonſtration. The Care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that what I judge to be true, ſhould not be made to paſs for Abſurd, which is a degree beyond what is meerly Erroneous, by being ſo ſeverely handled by a perſon of Doctor <hi>More's</hi> fame and Learning, induc'd me to begin the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb facs="tcp:58466:88"/>Paper, which ſhould have been ſhorter than now it is, but that I was perſwaded to lengthen it beyond what was either neceſſary or deſign'd, that I might, by the addition of ſome few thoughts and Experiments on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that were ſuggeſted to me, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to clear up and confirm ſome Hydroſtatical Truths, that, I fear, are but by very few either aſſented to, or perhaps ſo much as underſtood, and ſo might make the Reader amends for the trouble I was forc'd to give him in a Diſpute which I apprehended he might otherwiſe think himſelf but little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in. And he will, I hope, eaſily diſcern, that I have no mind to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him in my Preface with things not pertinent to the ſcope of it, if he take notice, that both for his ſake and the Learned Doctors, (whoſe Civility I would not leave unanſwered) I have reſtrain'd my ſelf to the Defenſive
<pb facs="tcp:58466:89"/>part, forbearing to attaque any thing in his <hi>Enchiridium Metaphyſicum,</hi> ſave the two Chapters wherein I was particularly invaded.</p>
                  <p>But though I have declin'd the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering my Opinion of the Doctors Book; yet I dare not forbear owning my not being ſatisfied with that part of his Preface, which falls foul upon <hi>Monſieur des Cartes</hi> and his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. For though I have often wiſh'd, that Learned Gentleman had aſcrib'd to the Divine Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a more particular and immediate efficiency and guidance in contriving the parts of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Matter into that great Engine we call the <hi>World;</hi> and though I am ſtill of Opinion, that he might have aſcrib'd more than he has to the Supreme Cauſe in the <hi>firſt</hi> Origine and Production of things Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, without the leaſt injury to Truth, and without much, if any, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb facs="tcp:58466:89"/>to his own Philoſophy; and though not confining my ſelf to any Sect, I do not profeſs my ſelf to be of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian: yet I cannot but have too much value for ſo great a wit as the founder of it, and too good an opinion of his ſincerity in aſſerting the exiſtence of a Deity, to approve ſo ſevere a Cenſure as the Doctor is pleaſed to give of him. For I have long thought, that in Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets about Religion, though it be very juſt to charge the ill conſequences of mens opinions upon the <hi>Opinions</hi> themſelves; yet 'tis not juſt, or at leaſt not charitable, to charge ſuch Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences upon the <hi>Perſons,</hi> if we have no pregnant cauſe to think, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern them, though they diſclaim them. And ſince men have uſually the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fathers for the Off-ſpring of their own Brains, I ſee not, why <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſius</hi> himſelf may not have over-look'd the bad inferences, that may be drawn
<pb facs="tcp:58466:90"/>from his Principles, (if indeed they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford any ſuch,) ſince divers Learned and not a few pious perſons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Divines of differing Churches, have ſo little perceiv'd, that the things objected are conſequent to ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that they not only abſolve them as harmleſs, but extol them as friendly and advantageous to natural Religion. And I ſee not, why ſo great and radiant a Truth, as that of the <hi>Exiſtence of a God,</hi> that has been acknowledg'd by ſo many meer Philoſophers, might not as well impreſs it ſelf on ſo capable an intellect as that of Monſieur <hi>des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> or that ſo piercing a wit may not really believe he had found out new <hi>Mediums</hi> to demonſtrate it by. And ſince the Learned <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> though an Eccleſiaſtick, had been able as well ſafely as largely to publiſh the irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Philoſophy of <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf; it ſeems not likely, that ſo dextrous a
<pb facs="tcp:58466:90"/>wit as that of Monſieur <hi>des Cartes,</hi> could not have propos'd his notions about the <hi>Mechanical Philoſophy,</hi> without taking ſo mean a courſe to ſhelter himſelf from danger, as in the moſt important points that can fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mans conſideration to labour with great skill and induſtry to deceive abundance of ingenious men, many of which appeared to be Lovers of <hi>Truth,</hi> and divers of them Lovers of <hi>Him</hi> alſo. And I am the more averſe from ſo harſh an opinion of a Gentleman, whoſe way of writing, even in his private Letters, tempts me very little to it, becauſe I cannot think him an Atheiſt and an Hypocrite, without thinking him (what Doctor <hi>More</hi> has too much celebrated him) to call him a weak head, and almoſt as bad a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> as a <hi>Man.</hi> For as far as I underſtand his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſome of the moſt important points of his Philoſophy (which if it were
<pb facs="tcp:58466:91"/>needful I could name) are inter woven with the Truth of the Exiſtence of a God, or do at leaſt ſuppoſe it, and are not demonſtrable without it. But I muſt not prevent the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> who, now he cannot do it for himſelf, I doubt not will Apologize for their Maſter; though looking upon him as a great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor to, though not the firſt founder of the Mechanical Philoſophy, I could not conſent by a total ſilence, upon ſuch an occaſion, to become any way acceſſary to the blemiſhing of his Memory.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>UPon the Advertiſement you gave me yeſternight, that I was particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Learned Doctor <hi>More's Enchiridium Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicum,</hi> I this day turn'd over the leaves of one, which I have freſhly receiv'd from the Reverend Author himſelf: And being aſſiſted by the <hi>ſeries</hi> of the Titles, I quickly lighted on that part
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58466:92"/>of the Book, whoſe ſubject made me expect to find my ſelf queſtion'd there, as I preſently found I was. For though that civil Adverſary is pleas'd to omit my name, and, the farther to diſguiſe it; imploys inſtead of it a great and unmerited <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> yet by the Book he cites, and the Experiments againſt which he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, 'tis very eaſily diſcoverable, that his objections are meant againſt me, who ſee yet no cauſe at all to be ſcrupulous to own my Name, and the Doctrine deliver'd in the paſſages he is pleas'd to oppoſe.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but you will preſently deſire to know, what I think of this much expected work; but when I have told you, that I have gained time to peruſe only (and that but curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) the 12th. and 13th. Chapters, you will, I queſtion not, excuſe a perſon that does exceedingly want
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58466:92"/>health, and yet wants not almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual avocations; if I now content my ſelf to give you my thoughts of that part of the newly mention'd Chapters, which properly relates to me; I ſay, that part of the Chapters, becauſe there are others wherein I need not intereſs my ſelf. For to omit other Paragraphs, the Doctor has in the former part of the 12th Chapter thought fit to ſeparate from my explication of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in queſtion betwixt us, that of the Learned <hi>Henricus Regius;</hi> and the later part of the ſame Chapter he imploys in an ingenious diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that would have the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erial Particles act with perception and deſign,
<note place="margin">Sect. 16, 17.</note> and (as he ſpeaks) <hi>pro re nata,</hi> which Opinion you will eaſily believe I neither was of, nor am like to adopt.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58466:93"/>
                  <p>It remains then, that ſetting aſide thoſe diſcourſes of the 12th Chapter, wherein it is needleſs that I ſhould make my ſelf a party; I proceed to conſider thoſe Paragraphs, which will be eaſily gueſs'd to be levell'd at my Explications, and by which I muſt confeſs, I cannot at all be yet convinc'd of their being falſe ones. But in doing this, I ſhall not only in complyance with my preſent haſte, but alſo to expreſs my reſpect to the Learned Doctor, forbear to ſay any more, than what I ſhall judge requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to anſwer the Objections, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concern my own Explications, without medling, by way of Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, with his <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> or Opinions, or endeavouring to ſet any paſſages of his Writings at variance among themſelves, or to take thoſe little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which are uſually ſought for by Diſputants.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58466:93"/>
                  <p>I ſhall not trouble you, nor tire my ſelf with any Schemes, ſince the Doctor has taken the pains to inſert thoſe that are neceſſary for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in his Book, and I have not my own at hand. Wherefore, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you have by you thoſe Books of mine he refers to, and ſuppoſing that you will, whilſt you are read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have alſo his Book with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Schemes before your eyes, I ſhall not ſpend time on any further Preamble, but immediately enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſideration of the Objections I am to anſwer.</p>

                        <p>THe firſt Explication of mine, that the Learned Doctor ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverts upon in his 12th Chapter, is, that which I give in the 33th of my Phyſico-Mechanical Experiments, touching the Spring and Weight of the Air; where I relate, that the Sucker in the Air-Pump of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, having been forcibly depreſs'd to the lower part of the Braſs <hi>Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which yet was carefully cloſed at the top, ſo that the cavity of the Cylinder was empty of Air; this Sucker, I ſay, would in this caſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſpontaneouſly to remount to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top of the Cylinder, though
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58466:94"/>it were clogg'd with a hundred pound weight to hinder its aſcent. Which <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> I aſcrib'd to this, that the Sucker being, by the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Air in the Cylinder, freed from the wonted force of the ſpringy Air that endeavour'd to depreſs the internal part of it, was not inabled by the appendant weight to reſiſt the preſſure of an Atmoſpherical Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der equal in diameter to it, which, preſſing againſt its lower or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſurface, endeavour'd to impel it up.</p>
                        <p>Now the Doctor having in the two firſt Paragraphs made a Deſcription of my Engine, (which I ſhall now paſs over) does in the third teach us, that the Corporeal cauſe, if there be any, of the aſcent of the Sucker, muſt be, either in the Sucker it ſelf, or in the almoſt exhauſted cavity of the Cylinder, or laſtly in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58466:95"/>Air: Which premiſed, he does in the ſame third Section, and in the fourth, endeavour to prove at large, that the cauſe is to be derived neither from the one, nor from the other of the two firſt. And therefore I, that maintain neither of the Opinions he diſputes againſt, ſhall leave thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphs of his untouch'd. Nor ſhall I meddle with the fifth, ſixth, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, where he argues againſt the explications of ſome, that would ſolve the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> upon ſome <hi>Carteſian</hi> grounds, and as well amply as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly againſt the ſolution that he ſuppoſes would be given of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly to his own Sentiments by the Learned <hi>Regius.</hi> Theſe Diſcourſes, I ſay, of the Doctors I leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd; becauſe 'tis at length in the eighth Paragraph, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnes that ſolution of the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon,</hi> which he aſcribes to me, whoſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58466:95"/>Opinion he firſt delivers, though not juſt in the terms I would expreſs it my ſelf; yet I dare ſay very ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo near my ſence, that I ſhall forthwith paſs from the eighth Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the beginning of the ninth, where he begins to propoſe his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which he is pleas'd to uſher in with a complement to me, that I ſhould be very vain if I looked upon as any thing more than a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>To his firſt Objection, propos'd in theſe words,
<note n="*" place="margin">139.</note> 
                           <hi>Primò enim, ſi haec ſolutio verè mechanica ſit, quae tandem Cauſa verè mechanica aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnari poteſt gravitationis ſingularum particularum, totiúſque atmoſphaerae in ſuis locis? Nam quod materiam ſubtilem attinet,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, that I did not in that Book intend to write a whole Syſteme, or ſo much as the Elements of Natural Philoſophy; but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58466:96"/>having ſufficiently proved, that the Air, we live in, is not devoid of weight, and is endowed with an Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Power or ſpringineſs, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by thoſe two Principles to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> exhibited in our Engine, and particularly that now under debate, without recourſe to a <hi>Fuga Vacui,</hi> or the <hi>Anima Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> or any ſuch unphyſical Principle. And ſince ſuch kind of Explications have been of late generally called Mechanical, in reſpect of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded upon the Laws of the Mechanicks; I, that do not uſe to contend about Names, ſuffer them quietly to be ſo: And to entitle my now examined Explication to be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical, as far as I pretend, and in the uſual ſence of that expreſſion, I am not obliged to treat of the cauſe of Gravity in general; ſince many Propoſitions of <hi>Archimedes, Stevinus,</hi>
                           <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58466:96"/>and thoſe others that have written of Staticks, are confeſſed to be Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically or Mechanically demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, though thoſe Authors do not take upon them to aſſign the true cauſe of Gravity, but take it for granted, as a thing univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that there is ſuch a quality in the Bodies they treat of. And if in each of the Scales of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and juſt Ballance, a pound weight, for inſtance, be put; he that ſhall ſay, that the Scales hang ſtill in <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> becauſe the equal weights counterpoiſe one another: and in caſe an ounce be put into one of the Scales, and not into the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; he that ſhall ſay that the loaded Scale is depreſs'd, becauſe 'tis urged by a greater weight than the other, will be thought to have given a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Explication of the <hi>Aequili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium</hi> of the Scales, and their loſing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58466:97"/>it; though he cannot give a true cauſe, why either of thoſe Scales tends towards the Center of the Earth. Since then the aſſigning of the true cauſe of Gravity is not required in the Staticks themſelves, though one of the principal and moſt known of the Mechanical Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines; Why may not other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Accounts, that <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> Gravity in the Air, (nay <hi>prove</hi> it, though not <hi>à priori)</hi> be look'd on as Mechanical?</p>

                        <p>THe next thing the Doctor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to my Explication, is a reſolute Denial, that there is any ſuch Gravitation, as I pretend, of Bodies, or their Particles, in their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58466:97"/>proper places. But becauſe, for the proof of his negation, he refers us to the next Chapter, we ſhall hereafter have a fitter place than this to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, he tells us, we may juſtly doubt of the equal diffuſion of the Springy power, or the Preſſure of the Air every way. In what ſence, in ſome caſes, I admit of a ſmall inaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity between the preſſure of Fluids againſt differing parts of a ſurrounded body, I have
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Paradoxes, eſp. cially Parad. 7.</note> elſewhere declared, and need not here diſcourſe of; ſince in the caſe before us, and in the like, that Preſſure is inconſiderable enough to be ſafely neglected. And whereas our Author thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 139.</note> 
                           <hi>Semotâ vi Elaſticâ, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulae tamen Atmoſphaerae deorfum tenderent. Eſt igitur depreſſio quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam deorſum praeter vim Elaſticam
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58466:98"/>ipſi ſuperaddita; ſurſum non item ſed elaſtica ſola, éſtque ſuppar ratio in preſſionious tranſverſis &amp; obliquis.</hi> I preſume, he did not ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our Hypotheſis and the nature of the preſſure of Fluid Bodies that have weight: For Water, to which no Springineſs is aſcribed, as there is to Air, but which acts by its weight and fluidity, is able upon the ſcore of thoſe Qualities to buoy up great Ships, that the ebbing Tide often leaves upon the ſtrand.</p>
                        <p>And whereas the Learned Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner propoſes a fourth Objection in theſe terms,
<note n="*" place="margin">p. 139.</note> 
                           <hi>Quibus omnibus addas, difficile eſſe intellectu, ſi unius Cylindri Atmoſphaerae pondus ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualis diametri cum Embolo reflectione in fundum Emboli derivetur, cur non quinque alii Cylindri Aeris qui cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtant Embolum in ejus fundum eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem modo ſimul agere poſſunt, ita ut
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58466:98"/>vis ſurſum impellens Embolum ſextuplo major ſit quàm hactenus ab bujus opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionis fautoribus exiſtim ita eſt. Quod ſi ſit, tunc certe, ſiquo artificio fieri poſſit ut unius ſolius Cylindri actio in Embolum admitteretur, re iquorum quinque excluſa, &amp; pari tamen faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate Embolus aſcenderet, manifeſtum indicium eſſet, ne unum quidem Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum Atſmoſphaerae agere in fundum Emboli, ſed totam Hypotheſin, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioſam tantummodo eſſe fictionem.</hi> I preſume, Hydroſtaticians will think, this might have been ſpared. For they will tell him, that there can no more of a fluid preſs directly upward againſt the Cylindrical Orifice of a Body immers'd in that fluid, than a Cylinder of that fluid of the ſame dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter with the Orifice (the lateral preſſures bearing againſt the lateral parts of the Cylinder.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you invert, for inſtance, a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58466:99"/>Pipe open at both ends, and filled to a certain height with Oyl, into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water; the Oyl that is kept up by the preſſure of the water upwards, will keep at the ſame height as to ſenſe, whether the Veſſel that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Water be broad or narrow, provided it be ſomewhat larger than the Orifice of the Pipe.</p>
                        <p>And now, to invalidate yet further the precedent Objections, made by the Doctor, I ſhall add, that it need not be thought incredible, that the Atmoſphere by its weight, or the Spring of the Air compreſs'd by that weight, ſhould be able to raiſe up fourſcore or a hundred pound, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sucker: Since I have
<note n="*" place="margin">See Continuat. of New Exper. Phyſico-Mechan. Exp. 48. p. 165.</note> manifeſted two or three years ago by a clear and cogent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, that a little air included in a Bladder will by its meer Spring be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58466:99"/>able to heave up a weight of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pound, and this without the help of any rarefaction by heat. By which Experiment may be alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, what I deliver'd a while ſince about the endeavour of the Air, that is wont to be included in our braſs Cylinder, by expanding it ſelf to thruſt away the Sucker (which, in regard of the ſtructure of the Pump, it can do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than downwards,) with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing force, aequivalent to the preſſure upwards of the Atmoſphere againſt the external part of the ſame Sucker.</p>

                        <p>BUt I ſhall not inſiſt upon the foregoing Objections, becauſe the Learned Doctor himſelf tells us,

                        <p>IN the next Paragraph (which is the 11th.) the Learned Doctor adds a further Objection, wherein he ſuppoſes, that there is laid upon a wooden Scale, of the ſame diameter with the above-mention'd Sucker, a lump of Butter of the ſame largeneſs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58466:101"/>with the Scale. Whence he argues, that if our Hypotheſis take place, the Butter muſt be preſs'd againſt by two Cylinders of Air, the one preſſing it upwards, the other downwards, and the preſſure of them both amounting to two hundred pounds. But, ſayes he, the Butter is not preſs'd at all, as appears by this, that no ſerous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is ſqueez'd out of it towards the edges, not ſo much as in thoſe parts that lie parallel to the <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,</hi> whence the Concluſion ſeems eaſie to be deduc'd.</p>
                        <p>But in the 12th Paragraph, the Doctor himſelf propoſes a Solution, which he might eaſily foreſee I would employ to invalidate his Argument; Namely, that the Air preſſing, as well againſt the ſides of the Butter, as againſt the top and bottom, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Maſs from horizontally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it ſelf. And whereas, by

What the Objector adds about the extruſion of what he calls a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler Element (ſuppoſed to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd in the Butter) by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Atmoſphere, in caſe it had

For the preſſure of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air, being equal on all ſides, if we ſuppoſe the ſuperficies of the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be diſtinguiſh'd into a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of little equal portions, each of theſe, whether they be ſcituated Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontally, or on the edges, can be preſs'd againſt but by an Atmoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Pillar equal to its Baſis; and the Horizontal portions, if I may ſo call them, cannot be thruſt out of place, without there be at the ſame time ſqueez'd out ſome of the Lateral por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58466:103"/>which yet cannot be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, becauſe they alſo are with equal force preſs'd (inwards) by little aerial Pillars, whoſe Baſes are contiguous to them, and bear againſt them. Which Anſwer, though of it ſelf ſufficient, may be much confirm'd by the Inſtance, you will hereafter meet with, of a lump of Butter that kept its irregular ſhape, in ſpight of a great and manifeſt preſſure of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſurrounded it.</p>
                        <p>And this Anſwer may ſuffice to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, what the Doctor annexes in the beginning of the 13th Paragraph, about the vaſt exceſs of Preſſure, which the Air exerciſes upon the flat and Horizontal ſurfaces of the above-mention'd lump of Butter, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the preſſure the Marginal parts of its ſurface can be expoſed to. What he adds, and illuſtrates with a Scheme, about the hands being
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58466:104"/>aſſiſted with the preſſure of the Air, it concerns not me to anſwer. But whereas among the places where the Elaſtical power of the Air is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not to reach, he reckons a Pail full of water, with a lump of butter put in it; he ſuppoſes that, which our Hydroſtaticks will by no means allow, and which is diſproved by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral both of our former Experiments, and by thoſe you will meet with in the following Papers. By which it appears, that the preſſure of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere is exerciſed, as indeed I do not ſee what ſhould hinder it from being, even upon Bodies that are quite immers'd under water; and by which, added to what has been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto diſcours'd in anſwer to the Learned Doctors Objections, you will eaſily judge, how deſervedly he ſhuts up the Arguments, we have been examining, with this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

                        <p>This Experiment, when I many years ago firſt publiſh'd it, I referr'd to the action of the Atmoſphere, which preſſing equally and ſtrongly againſt the ſurfaces of both the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, except where they were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, the higher could not be drawn directly upwards from the lower (and conſequently muſt be follow'd by it) by a leſs force than that which was equivalent to the weight of as great a Cylinder of the Atmoſphere as lean'd upon the upper Marble.</p>
                        <p>This Experiment thus explain'd, though it hath been judged a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58466:105"/>one to the Hypotheſis on whoſe behalf I alledged it, does yet to the juſtly famous Doctor ſeem a very conſiderable Argument againſt it, though for this judgement of his he urges only this reaſon, That if the force, with which the Air preſſes the lower Marble againſt the upper, be able to ſuſtain that Marble, though clogg'd with the great weight above mention'd, the ſame preſſure of Air would much more eaſily ſupport a Plate of wood brought to a true plain, and not loaded with any weight, if the wooden Plate were ſubſtituted to the lower Marble, and inſtead of it applied to the upper.</p>
                        <p>But ſince the Experiment, as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, did upon tryal ſucceed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, it had not been amiſs if the Learned Examiner had conſider'd it as it was really and ſucceſsfully made, and ſhewed why the preſſure of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58466:106"/>ambient Air was not able to hinder the ſeparation of the Marbles: And his needleſs ſubſtitution of a Wooden plate inſtead of the lower Marble ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſuggeſts a ſuſpition, that there may lie ſome fallacy, though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by him, in the variation he propoſes of the Experiment. And he ſeems to have himſelf had thoughts of this kind, by taking notice, that it may be anſwer'd on our behalf, that a Wooden Plate cannot be ſo exactly applied to the upper Marble, but that there will be a little Air intercepted between it and the bottom of that ſtone. And though having granted that it may be ſo, he employes two pages to ſhew, that this intermediate Air could not keep the preſſure of the Atmoſphere from ſupporting the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clogg'd plate of wood, if it had been That preſſure, which, when there was no ſuch intermediate Air, had ſuſtain'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58466:106"/>the lower Marble with all the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant weight; yet I confeſs his Proofs ſeem not to me to be anſwerable to the Aſſurance he uſes in ſpeaking of them. His Examples taken from Gunpowder and Wind, you will eaſily judge not to be very proper, where we are not conſidering a force that acts by a ſudden and vaniſhing <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus,</hi> but a conſtant and equal preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And as to his other Inſtance, which is taken from five men that thruſt againſt the ſixth (ſtanding with his back to a Wall) who is but as ſtrong as any one of them: I anſwer, that neither is this example near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of kin to our caſe. For each of theſe five men is ſuppoſed to have an equal power of thruſting, proper to himſelf, and independent from all or any of the other four. And the ſixth man is likewiſe ſuppoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt but by his own ſingle force, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58466:107"/>having his power of reacting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by the force wherewith the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thruſt againſt him. But in our caſe the thing is quite otherwiſe; for ſuppoſing that ſome aerial particles be ſo placed that a ſolid Body hinders them to recoil or expand themſelves, we are to conſider, that, as the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous corpuſcles of air preſs againſt them not by their own ſingle weight or preſſure, but as they tranſmit the action of all the other particles of the air which by their weight or preſſure thruſt them on; ſo the aerial parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, contiguous to the ſolid Body, reſiſt not barely by that force which they would have if they were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, but by vertue of the Sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſs they acquire upon the ſcore of the forcible inflection they ſuſtain from the action of the corpuſcles, that either mediately or immediately thruſt againſt them; and conſequently, in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58466:107"/>proportion to that external force, the Elaſticity of theſe compreſs'd Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles will be increaſed, as we ſee that a Bow or other Springy body, the more it is bent by an external force, the greater power it has to reſiſt further compreſſion. Upon which grounds it need to be no wonder, that a ſmall portion of Air, being almoſt included in a ſolid Body, and having for ſome (though but very little) time been expoſed to the outward air, ſhould be capable of reſiſting the preſſure of as much of the whole Atmoſphere, as can come to preſs againſt it. For, this preſſure of the Atmoſphere being continual, if the Springineſs of the aerial particles were not now great enough to reſiſt that preſſure, they muſt neceſſarily have been before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand inflected or compreſs'd by it, till the endeavours of the one and the other were reduced to an Aequipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58466:108"/>Of which I ſhall give you an inſtance in ſo obvious a body as a Bubble at the top of water: For though there be but a little Air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a very thin and tranſparent film of water; yet this little air is ſo well able to reſiſt the weight of all the Atmoſphere that can come to bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, that all the preſſure of it is not able to make the film ſhrink, or become wrinkled; which it would do, if the corpuſcles of the Internal air were not reduced to a Springineſs, which makes its power of reſiſting equal to the endeavour of the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Atmoſphere to compreſs it. And to let you ſee, that we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch a Springineſs of the air included in the Bubbles, I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where related, how by barely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the preſſure of the ambient air from Glaſs-Bubbles hermetically ſealed with air in them not compreſs'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58466:108"/>beyond its uſual ſtate, the Spring of the Internal air would make the Bubbles fly in pieces: And this will happen to ſtronger Glaſſes than Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as you will find in one of the former Experiments
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Tract about the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Airs Spring on bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>. And if we would illuſtrate what we are debating of by an Example; it ſhould not be by conſidering, as the Doctor does, the endeavour of five men againſt the ſixth that hath his back to the Wall; but that of five Bladders full of air, pil'd up, and reſting upon a ſixth. For in this caſe, whatever force or power of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing we ſuppoſe in the incumbent Bladders, they all bear jointly upon the lower, which <hi>continuing</hi> at a ſtand, muſt thereby be ſo compreſs'd as to be able to reſiſt their joint endeavours, as 'tis manifeſt; becauſe otherwiſe it would not continue in that ſtate, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58466:109"/>be farther compreſs'd; which is againſt the ſuppoſition.</p>
                        <p>This Notion about Preſſure and Reſiſtance I have the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deduced, becauſe I found many modern Naturaliſts, and even Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticians themſelves to be great ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to it. For which reaſon I ſhall add, that I have evinc'd it by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely deviſed Experiments in the Continuation of the Phyſico-Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Experiments
<note n="*" place="margin">Exper. 25. and elſewhere.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Air. Were it not for this, I ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have ſpared my ſelf the labour of ſetting down theſe thoughts as not neceſſary to the ſolution of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Objections. For he admits a Layer, or (as he aptly ſpeaks) an <hi>Area</hi> of Aerial Particles to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed between the upper Marble and the Wooden Plate; and therefore the flatneſs and ſtiffneſs of thoſe two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58466:109"/>muſt keep them from an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate contact as well at the edges as by the help of the ſame <hi>Area</hi> they do elſewhere; and conſequently that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed Air may communicate with the ambient Air. From whence the Laws of the Hydroſtaticks (which I have elſewhere ſhewn) will allow me to conclude, that the weight of the Atmoſphere endeavours to depreſs the upper ſurface of the wooden Plate; and ſo what the Examiner urges of the inconſiderable reſiſtance, that the few Aerial Particles interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the flat Bodies can make to the great preſſure of the Column of Air that thruſts the Woodden againſt the Marble Plate, would not conclude, though our former anſwer could not have been made; ſince the reſiſtance, made by the interpoſed Aerial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to the preſſure upwards of the Atmoſphere, is not in our preſent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58466:110"/>made by thoſe Particles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but by the weight of the lateral and ſuperior part of the Atmoſphere exerciſed by the intervention of theſe Particles. Which being ſo, what the Learned Doctor adds, that the weight of the wooden Plate it ſelf is here of no conſideration, muſt needs be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake. For the two equal Atmoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Preſſures, the one againſt the upper ſurface of the woodden Plate, and the other againſt the lower, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervailing and conſequently fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the endeavour of each other, the gravity of the wood it ſelf will ſuffice to make it fall, as well as if it were preſs'd againſt by neither of them. And from this Diſcourſe you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily judge, whether the Doctor had reaſon to ſay as he does,

For if we conceive with him, that the two flat Marbles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mention'd be ſuſpended, and that to the lower of them a flat wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den plate of the ſame ſhape and extent be applied; I ſee no cauſe to wonder, why the two Marbles ſhould ſtick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not the lower of them to the woodden plate. For, as I lately noted, there being an Area or Bed of Aerial Particles interpos'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Marble and the Wood, the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58466:111"/>weight of the Atmoſphere, exerciſed by the intervention of thoſe Aerial Corpuſcles, ought to be aequipollent to the preſſure of the Atmoſpherical Cylinder, that bears againſt the lower ſurface of the Plate; which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by its own weight muſt drop down: whereas there being no ſuch Layer of Aerial Particles interpoſed betwixt the two Marbles, the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ambient Atmoſphere, which touches them every where, ſave where their poliſh'd ſurfaces are contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, muſt keep them ſtrongly cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                        <p>I preſume I need not mind you, that hitherto I have diſcours'd upon ſuppoſition, that the Doctor <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally</hi> knows, what he delivers concerning the Non-adheſion of an exactly ſmooth woodden Plate to a Marble one: <hi>And</hi> upon his conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that, becauſe of the want of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58466:112"/>ſufficient congruity between the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces of two Bodies, there is a bed of Aerial Corpuſcles interpoſed between them. But now I think, it will not be unfit to take notice to you, that though, to illuſtrate on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a ſubject that is generally ſo little underſtood, as the exerciſe of Preſſion among fluid Bodies, I have anſwer'd my Learned Adverſaries Objections, as if I had nothing more to ſay for my Explication of the Suſpenſion of coherent Marbles, than what I many years ſince deliver'd in the little Tract by him cited; yet I have ſince abundantly confirmed that Explication by the 50th of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments publiſh'd in my <hi>Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which if the Doctor had been pleaſed to read, perhaps he would have received the ſame ſatisfaction that other Learned men have done: ſince there I experimentally ſhew,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58466:112"/>that the undermoſt Marble without the accuſtomed Clog, would, upon the bare withdrawing of the ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air, drop off from the upper. And whereas the two Marbles in our Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum would not cohere; as ſoon as the formerly excluded Air was let in upon them, it did by its ſupervening preſſure make them ſtick together ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrongly.</p>

                        <p>And now, Sir, I preſume you do not much wonder, if I think theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions reach the main thing I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. For though I do as freely and heartily, as the Doctor himſelf, (who, I dare ſay, does it very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,) admit or rather aſſert an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Being that made and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the world; yet all that I have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58466:114"/>endeavour'd to do in the Explication of what happens among Inanimate Bodies, is to ſhew, that, ſuppoſing the World to have been at firſt made and to be continually preſerv'd by Gods divine Power and Wiſdome; and ſuppoſing his General concourſe to the maintenance of the Laws he has eſtabliſhed in it, the Phaenomena, I ſtrive to explicate, may be ſolv'd Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically, that is, by the Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affections of Matter, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Natures abhorrence of a <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> to Subſtantial Forms, or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Incorporeal Creatures. And therefore, if I have ſhewn, that the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> I have endeavour'd to account for, are explicable by the motion, bigneſs, gravity, ſhape, and other Mechanical affections of the ſmall parts of liquors, I have done what I pretended; which was not to prove, that no Angel, or other imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial

                        <p>How little this Ratiocination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Experiments I have formerly told you of, about the caſes wherein Light bodies will be detain'd under water, or emerge to the top of it, you will eaſily perceive, if you compare the one with the other, which you may quickly do, if you pleaſe to compare the Doctors diſcourſe with the following Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of thoſe Tryals

                           </note>, to which alone I might therefore refer you.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58466:117"/>But yet in the mean time, you may, if you think fit, conſider a little, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Argument, whereon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor lays ſo much ſtreſs, be any more than a <hi>Paralogiſm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt then, ſince according to his computation the <hi>Area</hi> of the interval between the ſides of the Veſſel and the edges of the round boards, is 123 of ſuch parts, whereof the <hi>Area</hi> of the board amounts to 3721; 'tis evident, that there muſt be room enough for the water to paſs between the ſides of the veſſel and the edges of the board, which is ſuppos'd on all hands to be of ſome wood lighter <hi>in specie</hi> than water, ſince elſe it would not emerge upon the withdrawing of the ſtick.</p>
                        <p>Next, this Board or woodden Plate is not here intimated or ſuppoſed to be (and indeed in practice can ſcarce be) made exactly congruous to the bottom of the Veſſel; and conſequently
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58466:117"/>the water may get in between them; for which cauſe 'tis neceſſary to keep the woodden Plate forcibly down with a ſtick, which elſe were needleſs. And conſequently this interpoſed water will communicate with the laterally ſuperior water in the Veſſel, which ſuperior water may, according to the Laws Hydroſtatical, by the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the interpoſed, exerciſe its preſſure upwards againſt the lower ſurface of the woodden Plate.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the Doctors Scheme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and aſſiſts us to conceive, (which we may do however,) an imaginary Plane of water to be parallel to the bottom of the Veſſel, and to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the bottom of the Board; ſo that, of the water that lies between this Plane and the bottom of the Veſſel, one part is cover'd by the woodden Plate; and the other, between the edges of that and the ſides of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58466:118"/>tub, is cover'd with the incumbent water only.</p>

                        <p>THeſe things being premis'd, I thus argue: 'Tis manifeſted by Hydroſtaticians after <hi>Archimedes,</hi> that in water, thoſe parts that are moſt preſs'd, will thruſt out of place thoſe that are leſs preſs'd: which both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the common apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and might, if it were needful, be confirm'd by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 'Tis alſo evident, that that part of the above-mention'd imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Plane, that is cover'd by the woodden Plate, muſt be preſſed by a leſs weight than the other part of the ſame Plane; becauſe the wood being bulk for bulk lighter than water, the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58466:118"/>aggregate of the wood and water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on the cover'd part of the ſame Plane muſt be lighter <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> than the water alone that is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the uncover'd part of the ſame Plane; and conſequently this uncover'd part being more preſs'd than the other part of the Plane, the heavier muſt diſplace the lighter, which it cannot do but by thruſting up the board, as it does, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal force that kept it down is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. And, to add this upon the by, this greater preſſure againſt the bottom than againſt the top of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies immers'd in water ſpecifically heavier than they, is a true reaſon of their emerſion, as I have elſewhere ſhewn. So that there happens no more in this caſe than what uſually happens in the aſcenſion of bodies in liquors ſpecifically heavier than themſelves, on the account of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58466:119"/>newly mention'd difference of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And 'tis with an (expreſs or ſuppos'd) exception of ſuch a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which in many other caſes may be ſafely neglected, that (which I deſire you to take notice of,) in moſt places of this diſcourſe I ſpeak of the Preſſure of ambient Fluids on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed Solids as uniform or every way equal.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, that according to the Doctors ſupputation, if the ſolid Cylinder, conſiſting of the woodden Plate, and all the water directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on it, were put into an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ballance, it would there many times out-weigh the hollow Cylinder of water alone that leans upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd part of the imaginary Plane. And that is it that ſeems to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Learned Doctor. But there are divers Hydroſtatical Caſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> depends not ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58466:119"/>much upon the abſolute weight of the compared Bodies, as upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective and their ſpecifick Gravity; on whoſe account it is, that a ſmall Pible, for inſtance, that weighs not a quarter of an Ounce, will readily ſink to the bottom of the river, on whoſe ſurface a log of wood of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound in weight will float. 'Tis a Rule in Hydroſtaticks, that when two portions of water or any other Homogeneous liquor preſs againſt each other, the prevalency will goe, not according to the abſolute weight, but the perpendicular height of thoſe Portions. And accordingly we find, that if a ſlender pipe of glaſs, being fill'd with water, have its lower ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unſtop'd at the bottom of a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of water, which contains much more of that liquor than the pipe; yet if this laſt named water were, for inſtance, two foot high, and that in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58466:120"/>the Veſſel but one, the water in the pipe will readily ſubſide, till it come almoſt to a level with the external water, though it cannot do ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out raiſing the whole maſs of water that ſtagnated in the veſſel.</p>
                        <p>And now I ſhall ſubjoin an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, though at firſt it may ſeem ſlight, and was made in leſſer glaſſes &amp; quantitys than I would have imploy'd if I could have procur'd better Accommodations, has the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of requiring no curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and yet I hope will ſerve for an ocular proof of the fallaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that reaſoning the Doctor is ſo ſtrangely confident of.</p>
                        <p>We took an open mouth'd glaſs, ſuch as ſome call Jarrs, and Ladys often uſe to keep ſweet meats in, which was three inches and a half or better in <hi>Diameter,</hi> and ſomewhat leſs in depth; and had the figure of its cavity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58466:120"/>Cylindrical enough. Into this hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put ſome water to cover the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberance, wont to be at the bottom of ſuch glaſſes, we took a convenient quantity of Bees-wax, and having juſt melted it, we poured it cautiouſly into the glaſs, warm'd before-hand to prevent its cracking, till it reach'd to a convenient height. This veſſel and the contained liquors we ſet aſide to cool, in expectation, that when the heat, that had dilated the wax, was gone, it would ſhrink from the glaſs, and conſequently leave a little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val every where between the concave ſuperficies of the veſſel, and convex of the harden'd wax; which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly came to paſs, and ſav'd me the labour of getting the wax ſhap'd for my purpoſe with tooles; which might have been done but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble and leſs exactneſs. And now 'twas eaſie for me to try the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58466:121"/>I deſign'd; for, pouring in warily ſome water between the glaſs and the wax, ſo that it fill'd all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, left between thoſe two bodys both at the bottom and the ſides, the wax was made preſently to float, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſibly lifted up from the bottom, and its upper part appearing a little above the level of the water, which was no more than I did, and had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect, according to the true Principles of Hydroſtaticks. For water being ſomewhat, though but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, heavier, <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> than wax, and that which was poured into the bottom and ſtagnated there, being preſs'd by the collateral water, every way interpos'd between the concave part of the Glaſs and the convex of the Wax (ſo that this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral liquor anſwer'd what I lately called a hollow Cylinder of water in the Doctors Experiment) that part
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58466:121"/>of the ſtagnant water, that was lean'd upon by the wax, being leſs preſs'd than the other part of the ſame ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant water was by the water incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on it; this latter muſt diſplace the former, which it could not doe but by raiſing up the wax that lean'd upon it. And yet this collateral wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo far from being heavier than the wax its preſſure impell'd up, that both the collateral, and the ſtagnant water all together, being weigh'd in good ſcales, amounted to little above a quarter of the weight of the wax, which happen'd by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the narrowneſs of the Veſſel, which, if it had been wide enough, I doubt not but the experiment would have ſucceeded, though the wax had outweigh'd the collateral water ten times more than in our experiment it did. But that the ſolid body excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded almoſt four times the weight,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58466:122"/>not onely of the collateral but the ſtagnant liquor too, does ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrow the Doctors ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whoſe fallaciouſneſs will yet further appear by two other improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, among others, which I made of one Experiment.</p>
                        <p>For I. though we pour'd in more and more water, as long as the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel would contain any, the Cylinder of wax was but lifted higher and higher from the bottom of the glaſs, but did not appeare rais'd more than at the firſt, above the upper ſurface of the water; which argues, that 'twas not at all the Quantity of the inferior water, which was continually increas'd, but the preſſure of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral water, which continued ſtill at the ſame height in reference to that wax, that caus'd the elevation of the body.</p>
                        <p>And II. to manifeſt yet more
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58466:122"/>clearly the Doctors miſtake, I devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the following tryal. We took a round plate of Lead about the thickneſs of a ſhilling, and having made it ſtick faſt to the bottom of the Cylinder of wax, to make this body ſink the more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we placed one after another upon the upper part of the wax divers grain weights (firſt wetted to keep them from floating) till we had put on enough to make the wax ſubſide to the bottom: For the facilitating whereof we had par'd off its edges; by this means, the glaſs having been at firſt almoſt fill'd with water, there ſwam about an inch or better of that liquor above the upper ſurface of the wax. And laſtly, we took off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the grain weights that we had put on, till we ſaw the wax, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the adhering Lead, riſe, by degrees, to the top of the water,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58466:123"/>above which ſome part of it was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly extant.</p>
                        <p>From this experiment I thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue: 'Tis manifeſt, that, according to the Doctors ſuppoſition, here was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon the wax a <hi>Cylinder</hi> of an inch in height and of the ſame <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter</hi> or breadth with the round ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the wax, whereas upon the removing part of the water, that lay at the bottom when the wax began to riſe, there was incumbent no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weight than that of the collateral water, and as much of the ſuperior and ſtagnant, as was directly imcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon that collateral water (and would have deſerv'd the ſame name, if we had ſuppos'd the convex ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the wax to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued upwards as high as the glaſs reach'd.) But now, whereas, according to the Doctors ratiocination, this Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of water incumbent on the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58466:123"/>wax, being an inch deep, and a good deal above three inches broad, muſt preſs the wax with a greater weight by ſeveral times, than that which the lateral and hollow <hi>Cylinder</hi> of this ſtagnant water could have upon the reſt of the collateral water; yet the height of this aggregate of collateral waters being the ſame with that of the wax and the water ſwimming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, the difference of the preſſure was ſo ſmall, that barely taking off a weight of four or five grains, the wax would, notwithſtanding the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the water incumbent on it, be impell'd up and made to float: And by the like weight, put again upon it, it would be made to ſink, and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther removal of ſuch a weight, (for I purpoſely reiterated the tryal more than once,) it would, though ſlowly, reaſcend. And theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> do ſo much depend upon a Mechanical
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58466:124"/>aequipollence of preſſure, that even four grains would not have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make the wax riſe or ſink, if it had not been for ſome little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental impediments, that are eaſily met with in ſuch narrow glaſſes; for otherwiſe in a larger Veſſel we have made the ſame Lump of Wax readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough ſink or float, by the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in or taking off a ſingle grain or perhaps leſs.</p>
                        <p>By this you may ſee, that for the Regulation of Hydroſtatical things, Nature has her ballance too as well as Art, and that in the ballance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Statical Laws are nicely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough obſerv'd.</p>
                        <p>You may alſo take notice, upon the by, how little the weight of the Cylinder of water upon a body im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in ſtagnant water is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, whilſt there is a preſſure of collateral water to counterballance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58466:124"/>it; ſince in this laſt tryal, though the <hi>Cylinder</hi> of incumbent water did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increaſe or decreaſe in length, whilſt the lump of Wax was ſinking or emerging; yet the ſame deſpicable weight of a grain or leſs, that was juſt able to depreſs it beneath the upper ſurface of the water, did by its preſſure or removal procure its ſinking to the very bottom, or riſing again to the top, and on both occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with an equal ſlowneſs, bating that little acceleration of motion, that ought to happen upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and which therefore is to be obſerv'd in the wax, during its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as well as during its ſinking.</p>

                        <p>SOme other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> I produc'd, by varying the hitherto menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd experiment, which are very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to our Notions about Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticks. But, ſince they do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly concern the preſent Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, I ſhall in this place only annex a couple, the former whereof affords an eaſie confirmation of that Paradox, which we lay as the ground of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, and the contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is maintan'd not only by Doctor <hi>More,</hi> but by many other famous and Learned men, namely, that in ſtagnant water the upper parts do actually preſs the lower.</p>
                        <p>Wee took then a very ſlender pipe of glaſs, whoſe Cavity was nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than that of an ordinary Gooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quill, that heterogeneous Liquors
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58466:125"/>may not be able to get by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it. This Pipe near one end was bent upwards like a Syphon, that it might have a ſhort leg as Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel as the Artificer could make it to the longer. Into this crooked Pipe we put a little oyl, and then held it perpendicularly in a ſomewhat deep and wide-mouth'd Glaſs fill'd partly with Water and partly with a Lump of Wax, of the bigneſs and ſhape of that already mention'd; that ſo the preſſure of the incumbent Water upon the open orifice of the ſhorter Leg, might impel the oyl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the longer Leg, ſomewhat above the ſurface of the water in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; which 'twas convenient ſhould be done, that we might the better ſee the motions of the Oyl, and which we knew <hi>muſt</hi> be done by the courſe we took; both becauſe Oyl is lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi> than Water, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58466:126"/>required not an equal height of Water to counterballance it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in very ſlender Pipes, Water is wont to aſcend a little above the Level of the External Water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into they are immers'd. The Pipe being, as was ſaid, held upright, 'twas eaſie to take notice by a mark, fix'd on the outſide, to what height the Oyl reach'd in it.</p>
                        <p>Now if we conceive a Horizontal Plane, Parallel to the bottom of the Veſſel, to paſs by the Baſis of the floating Wax, 'tis evident by what has been formerly ſhewn, that, of this Imaginary Plane, that part on which the Wax is incumbent is as ſtrongly preſs'd by the weight of the Wax, as the Lateral part of the ſame Plane is by the weight of the Water incumbent on it; (otherwiſe theſe Preſſures would not be aequipollent, but the Wax would be raiſed:) And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58466:126"/>that part of this Plane, that is placed directly over the Orince of the ſhorter Leg of the Pipe, is no more preſſed, than any equal portion of that part of the ſame Plane that is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by the Wax. This Body being taken out of the Water, the Liquor ſubſided a great way in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and ſo did proportionably the Oyl in the longer Leg of the Pipe. And laſtly, having weigh'd out in a good pair of Scales as much Water, as we found the Wax to amount to, this Liquor was, inſtead of the Wax, poured into that which remained in the Glaſs; whereupon the Oyl, in the longer leg of the Pipe, was again impell'd up (very near) to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Marke to which it had been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Wax. Whence we may gather, that the Water newly put in, though in the Air it weigh'd no more than the Wax; yet it did as much
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58466:127"/>preſs the Water, that lay beneath the foremention'd Imaginary Plane, and conſequently that, which was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over the ſhorter Leg of the Pipe, as the Wax, that had been taken out, had done. And ſince we have already proved, that the Wax did confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably preſs that Plane, it ought not to be denyed, that the Water alſo (which inſtead of it was able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell up the Oyl in the Pipe) did in like manner preſs that Plane; and conſequently that Water may gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in Water, as well as a ſolid Body, ſuch as Wax is, can. And this is the <hi>firſt</hi> additional uſe I told you I would make of our Experiment.</p>
                        <p>But, (to come now to the <hi>ſecond</hi>) there is another <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of it, viz. the abovemention'd tenderneſs of Nature's Ballance, whoſe uſe ſeems to be of no leſs general concernment to the true Doctrine of the Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58466:127"/>For, by duely conſidering that <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> and reaſoning a while upon it, we may be help'd to rectifie that plauſible Miſtake, which has long deluded both Philoſophers and Mathematicians, and does yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on moſt of them; namely, that a Body does not actually gravitate when it does not deſcend. For we have ſeen already, and ſhall further ſhew by and by, that the ſunken Wax and the Braſs grains that lie on it, do actually preſs or gravitate upon the ſubjacent Water and Bottom of the Veſſel on which 'tis incumbent; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently its preſſure being not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted by that of the Collateral Water, which is unable to raiſe it, muſt be as great, as that of this colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Water. Therefore, when upon the removal of a ſingle Grain, the Wax with its incumbent weight is made to aſcend, and that but very
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58466:128"/>ſlowly, 'tis evident, that 'twas ſo far from not gravitating before, becauſe it did not actually deſcend, that it retain'd its Gravity even whilſt it <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends:</hi> As may appear <hi>not only</hi> by the ſlowneſs of its motion upwards, proceeding from its being in Nature's Ballance very little leſs heavy than it need be to countervail the preſſure of the Collateral Water; <hi>but</hi> by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that if but a ſingle grain be laid on it when it begins to riſe, its aſcenſion will be check'd and hindred, which could not be done by the addition of ſo inconſiderable a weight, if the Wax and the adhering Metall did not, even during their aſcent, retain their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer gravity, though that were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated as to the act of deſcending, or ſo much as keeping their ſtation by the prevailing preſſure of the colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Water: So that, ſince, (as we found) the Wax and adhering Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58466:128"/>amounted to a good deal above 4000 Grains, it did in the Ballance of Nature weigh, whilſt it was aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, not ſo much as a 4000th part leſs than it did, whilſt it was actually deſcending.</p>

                        <p>I Should beg your pardon, Sir, for having detain'd you ſo long with my Reply to a ſingle Objection of the Doctors, how pompouſly ſoever propos'd; but that I thought it not amiſs to do ſome ſervice to the true Theory of Hydroſtaticks, by taking this occaſion to preſent you ſome things that I thought not unlikely to illuſtrate ſome parts of that Theory; though above what was neceſſary to anſwer the Doctors Argument; to which I confeſs I was troubled to ſee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58466:129"/>ſo Learned a man ſubjoin the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing concluſion: <hi>Haec tam lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenta Demonſtratio contra Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem particularum aquae inter ſe quamvis junctae ſitulae fundum ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, ſi non ſit vera atque ſolida, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem nec mei ipſius nec ullius un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam mortalis in poſterum ratiocini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is credam.</hi> But I hope he will not be as bad as his word, but will be pleas'd to conſider as well as I do for him, that a man may be very happy in other parts of Learning and of greater moment, that has had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to miſtake in Hydroſtaticks, a diſcipline which very few Scholars have been at all vers'd in, and about which divers of thoſe few have had the misfortune to err, not only in the concluſions they have drawn, but in the very Principles they have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
                        <p>To the foregoing Argument the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58466:129"/>Doctor, though he declares he thinks it needleſs, adds in the 5th Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph another, taken from the Laſt experiment of my Hydroſtatical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes, by which he ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, that I ſeem at firſt ſight to have demonſtrated what I pretend to, about the gravitation of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts of ſtagnant water upon the lower. And I am ſorry that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in return acknowledge, that his objection at firſt ſight ſeem'd to me a cogent one: For, neither at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond nor third peruſal can I clearly diſcern where his Ratiocination lyes, ſuppoſing it to be meant for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my experiment. And though I conſulted with ſome Learned Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Royal Society, whereof two are Mathematicians, and one his particular friend; yet they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd he had not ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd himſelf on this occaſion, nor
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58466:130"/>could they ſhew me to what argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I might properly direct my reply. Only one of the Doctors Correſpondents, having ſeriouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd his diſcourſe and the annex'd ſcheme, told me that what ſeem'd the moſt probable to him, was, that though the Doctor was too Civil to give me, <hi>in ter ninis,</hi> the Lye; yet he did indeed deny the matter of fact to be true. Which I cannot eaſily think, the Experiment having been tryed both before our whole Society, and very Critically, by its Royal Founder his Majeſty himſelf. But, ſince you have your ſelf ſeen and made it more than once, I need not ſpend words to convince you that the matter of fact is true.</p>
                        <p>But after I had in vain ſought the Doctors meaning where I expected it, chancing lately to caſt my Eyes on another place, where I ſaw my Scheme
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58466:130"/>repeated, I find this paſſage in the Explication he endeavours to give of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> by his <hi>Hylarchical</hi> Principle; <hi>Cùm verò tam profundè immergitur tubus, ut obturaculum tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Superficiem V.

But if I miſtake the Doctors
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58466:131"/>meaning I am to be excuſed, ſince I do it not willingly, and his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity has been acceſſary to it. Nor am I very apprehenſive of being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend my account of an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, which (as you know) has had the good fortune to recommend the Doctrine, for the Proof whereof I devis'd it, to many Learned and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, ſeveral of which were ſufficiently indiſpos'd to admitt it.</p>
                        <p>And to avoid all miſtakes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes that may ariſe (which I think they muſt do needleſsly) upon the ſcore of the <hi>Valve</hi> imploy'd in our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, I ſhall remind you of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that I remember I have ſome times ſhew'n you and divers other <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> though I remember not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have mention'd it in any of my publiſh'd writings. The Summ of this tryal is, that an arbitrary Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Quickſilver, being by Suction
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58466:131"/>rais'd into a very ſlender glaſs-pipe, whoſe upper Orifice is ſtop'd with the Experimenters finger, to keep the Mercury from falling before its time, the open end of the pipe with the Mercury in it is thruſt into a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently deep glaſs of water till the little <hi>Cylinder</hi> of Mercury have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſurface of the water, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to a depth, that is at leaſt 14 times as great as the Mercurial Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has of <hi>height.</hi> For then, the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger being remov'd from the upper orifice, the glaſs-pipe will be open at both ends, and there will be nothing to hinder the Quickſilver's falling down to the bottom, but the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Cylinder</hi> of water, that is under it, which <hi>Cylinder</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt but by vertue of the weight or preſſure of the ſtagnant water that is ſuperior to it, though but collateral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plac'd above it: And yet this
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58466:132"/>water being by the pipe, whoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part is higher than its ſurface, and acceſſible only to the air, kept from preſſing againſt the Mercury any where but at the bottom of the Pipe, and being about a 14th part of the weight of an equal bulk of Mercury, it is able at that depth to make the ſubjacent water preſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward againſt the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is but a 14th part as high as the water is deep, with a force equivalent to that of the gravity wherewith the Mercury tends downwards. And to manifeſt, that this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends meerly upon the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> of the two liquors; if you gently raiſe the lower end of the pipe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſurface of the water, this liquor, being not then able to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſuch a preſſure as it could at a further and greater depth, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury preponderating will, in part,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58466:132"/>(more or leſs, as the pipe is more or leſs rais'd) fall out to the bottom of the glaſs. But if, when the Quickſilver is at the firſt depth, inſtead of raiſing the pipe you thruſt it down farther under the water, the preſſure of that liquor againſt the Mercury increaſing with its depth, will not only ſuſtain the Mercury, but impell it up in the pipe to a conſiderable diſtance from the lower orifice of it, and keep it near about the ſame diſtance from the ſurface of the laterally ſuperior water. And this experiment may not only ſerve for the purpoſe, for which I here alledge it; but alſo, if duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd and applyed, may very much both illuſtrate &amp; confirm the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation formerly given of the ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpontaneous aſcent of the clogg'd ſucker in our exhauſted Air-pump.</p>
                        <p>The laſt Argument, the Doctor urges againſt the Gravitation of water
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58466:133"/>in what they call its proper place, is deduc'd from what happens to the <hi>Divers,</hi> who in the mid'ſt of the Sea, though the ſalt water of that be much heavier than that of freſhwater Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, do not find themſelves oppreſs'd, or ſo much as feel themſelves harm'd or compreſs'd by the vaſt load of the incumbent water.</p>
                        <p>But that the Equality of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of an ambient fluid will goe a great way towards the ſolving of this Difficulty, you will find, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and conſiderations you will meet with in the following
<note n="*" place="margin">The Author means the New experiments of the differing preſſure of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſolids, &amp; fluids,</note> Papers, to which, for that reaſon, I referr you. And though the Doctor in this ſame Paragraph objects, <hi>Tametſi haec preſſio aequalis ſit, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil tamen impedit quò minùs ſubtiliores partes corporis magiſque fluidas expri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat &amp; elidat.</hi> I remember I anſwer'd
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58466:133"/>that exception before, by ſaying, that thoſe liquors that he ſuppoſes ſhould be ſqueez'd out, cannot be ſo, becauſe there is as great a preſſure againſt thoſe parts at which they ſhould iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, as againſt any of the reſt, if the parts that ſhould be ſqueez'd out be not too ſpirituous and ſubtile, which if they be, I ſhould gladly learn how the Doctor knows that no ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and ſpirituous particles are really expell'd: eſpecially if that be obſerv'd, which we ſhall ſoon have occaſion to relate, that a ſmall animal, being vehemently compreſs'd in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeem'd a little, though but a little, to ſhrink.</p>
                        <p>But that we may the more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider this grand argument, taken from the experience of the <hi>Divers,</hi> that is wont to be employ'd by the Schooles and others for the vulgar Opinion, and is now urg'd by the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58466:134"/>Learned Doctor to prove <hi>His;</hi> 'twill be convenient to obſerve, that it does, at once, both propoſe a Queſtion, and contain an Objection, grounded upon the ſurmis'd inſolubleneſs of that Queſtion.</p>
                        <p>And to begin with the Probleme, <hi>Whence it is, that</hi> Divers <hi>are ſo far from being kill'd or oppreſs'd by the weight of the incumbent water, that they are not ſo much as hurt by it, nay, that they ſcarce feel it at all?</hi> We may take notice, that there is in it ſomewhat ſuppos'd, as well as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what demanded. For, in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion 'tis taken for granted, that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> though at never ſo great a depth, feel no preſſure exerciſed againſt them by the water; which is an affirmation in point of fact, of whoſe truth I make ſome queſtion, for the reaſons I ſhall ere long have occaſion to mention.</p>
                        <p>But it will clear the way for what
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58466:134"/>is to follow, if I here divide the noble and difficult Problem, we are to conſider, into two Queſtions; the <hi>firſt,</hi> why a <hi>Diver</hi> ſhould not be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and cruſh'd to death by the preſſure of the Incumbent and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient water. And the <hi>ſecond,</hi> why at leaſt he ſhould not be made ſenſibly to feel it by ſuffering ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inconvenience from it.</p>
                        <p>In anſwer to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, you will eaſily perceive, that divers things may be pertinently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that you will meet with in the following Paper, to ſhew the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt the preſſure of <hi>Fluid</hi> and that of <hi>Solid</hi> bodies. And that <hi>de facto</hi> the preſſure of water may be exceeding great without deſtroying an <hi>Animal</hi> quite ſurrounded with that liquor; I have long ſince ſhewn in another

For there being in our caſe an <hi>animal,</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly much more tender than a man, expos'd to a preſſure which he affirms is ſo great, that if it were exercis'd on the <hi>Tadpole,</hi> it ought to ſqueeze out all his guts, I think I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have given a pertinent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that a <hi>Diver</hi> may be at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable depth under water preſerv'd from being cruſh'd to death by the weight of it. And whereas the <hi>Doctor</hi> tells us, that the cauſe of the Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumity of the <hi>Tadpole</hi> is, that the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or contruſion of the particles of the water againſt one another is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd or fruſtrated by the <hi>Principium
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58466:136"/>Hylarchicum,</hi> I reply; That what I affirm is matter of Fact, and <hi>evident,</hi> (namely, that there was a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal force duly and yet ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applyed to preſs to Death by means of the water the <hi>animal</hi> ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in it;) but that this Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal force was ſuſpended or made ineffectual by ſome inviſible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Agent, is but the Doctors <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and a thing, which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or no, is at leaſt not manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>Having ſaid thus much about the <hi>firſt</hi> Queſtion; I now proceed to the ſecond, <hi>Why Divers though at never ſo great a depth complain not of the preſſure of the water, nor ſuffer any harm nor inconvenience by it?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And here, <hi>Sir,</hi> the Queſtion highly meriting a particular Curioſity, I ſhall not ſcruple in the more full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, I am now entring upon, as well
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58466:137"/>ſometimes to employ and inlarge par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars already mentioned in the laſt of the following Papers, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſtrengthen them with new ones. And I ſhall alſo for a while ſuſpend my difference with the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> and addreſſing my ſelf to you, who, I am ſure, will allow me that water weighs in water, propoſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my cuſtom, not as a Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſt, but as an Inquirer, ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that may tend to the Solution of a <hi>Problem,</hi> which I take to be as difficult as noble. Not that I doubt but it muſt and will be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated upon the Mechanical Principles; but <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe the application of them to the Solution will not offer it ſelf to every ſeeker; and <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe we are not yet well furniſhed, either with experiments made on bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies under water, or ſo much as with ſo competent an account of the matter
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58466:137"/>of fact, as I think may keep wary men from heſitations about it. For, what is commonly reported concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Divers,</hi> is (as has above been intimated) grounded but upon their own Relations and anſwers, perhaps amplified or procur'd by leading Queſtions from perſons, who are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally either ſlaves or ignorant men, taken from the leſs ſober part of the illiterate vulgar, and prepoſſeſt with the common opinion of the non-gravitation of water in its own place; and conſequently are not like to make over-accurate obſervations, but prone to refer the inconvenient alterations, they feel, to any other cauſe than the preſſure of the water, which they are taught to be none at all. If obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations about Diving were made by Philoſophers and Mathematicians, or, at leaſt, intelligent men, who would mind more the bringing up out of

                           <hi>All along this coaſt &amp; ſo up to Ozaca, we found women Divers, that liv'd with their houſhold and family in boats upon the water, as in Holland they do the like. Theſe women would catch fiſh by Diving, which by net &amp; line they miſs'd, and that in eight fathom depth. Their eyes by continually diving grew as red as blood, whereby you may know a diving Woman from all other Women.</hi> I know, it may be ſaid, that theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58466:139"/>may proceed from the coldneſs and moiſture or other qualities of the Sea; nor would I confidently reject ſuch a ſurmiſe: But it may alſo be poſſible, that the compreſſion, they ſuffer'd under water, might have at leaſt a ſhare in the production of theſe ill effects. For how are we yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the preſſure of the water againſt their bodies, though it does not manifeſtly diſlocate any ſolid or firm part, but only ſomewhat preſs inwards, as in the above mentioned Tadpole the outward skin and the fibres, (both which will eaſily yield a little way without being painfully ſtretch'd,) may not, by ſtraitning the Veſſels, and otherwiſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, alter the circulation of the blood and the motion of the humors, ſpirits, and other fluid parts of the body? And I am not ſure, that much of the cold, that <hi>Divers</hi> are
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58466:139"/>wont to complain of, when under water, may not be a diſaffection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in the nervous and membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous parts, occaſioned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ambient water, there being divers things, and preſſure among others, beſides actual cold, that will make men complain of being cold; and in our caſe this ſenſation may be excited or aſſiſted by the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the uſual perſpiration at the conſtipated pores of the skin. And it ſeems not impoſſible, that one, not ſo ignorant and heedleſs as <hi>Divers</hi> are wont to be, may refer a new ſenſation, that really proceeds from preſſure, to other Cauſes; ſince Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Intelligent men, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt (as theſe Common <hi>Divers</hi> uſually are) with the vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about the Non-gravitation of Water and Air in their natural places,

But all theſe things I have mentioned, not as if I laid any great weight upon each of them, but to let you ſee, that 'twas not altogether without cauſe, that I complain'd of the incompetency of the Hiſtory of what Divers feel under water; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at great depths, where this want of information may be more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: For, as far as I have yet learnt by peruſing Voyages and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58466:140"/>of Travellers of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the places, where they are wont to dive for Pearl, are but moderately deep, and indeed ſhallow in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the great depths of the Sea; ſo that if we were furniſhed with as many Relations of theſe profound places, as we have of the others, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the accounts would be different enough to render doubtful or to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the received opinions about the conditions of <hi>Divers</hi> at the bottom of the Sea. For, I remember that a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible eye-witneſs, who, (if I miſtake not) was the Intelligent <hi>Oviedo,</hi> ſpeaking of the Pearl-fiſhing on the American Iſland of <hi>Cubagna,</hi> has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other notable obſervations ſuch a paſſage as this; <hi>But whereas the place is very deep, a man cannot naturally reſt at the bottom by reaſon of the abundance of aery ſubſtance, which is in him, as I have oftentimes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58466:141"/>proved. For although he may by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and force deſcend to the bottom, yet are his feet lifted up again, ſo that he can continue no time there. And therefore where the Sea is very deep, theſe Indian Fiſhers uſe to tye two great ſtones about them with a coard, on each ſide one, by the weight whereof they deſcend to the bottom, and remain there until them liſteth to riſe again, at which time they unlooſe the ſtones and riſe up at their pleaſure.</hi>

                        <p>And now to come cloſer to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our difficult <hi>Problem;</hi> there yet occurrs to me nothing more likely in order to it, than what I have already mentioned in the Paper you will meet with about the <hi>Differing preſſures,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore it ſhall here ſuffice me to enlarge, and by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſiderations and Experiments confirm, what is there more ſummarily diſcourſed; namely, That the Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58466:141"/>may depend (chiefly) upon theſe two things, the <hi>uniform preſſure</hi> of the fluid Ambient, and the <hi>robuſt texture</hi> of a humane body expos'd to this Preſſure.</p>

<note n="*" place="margin">New Experiments about the differing Preſſure of heavy Solids and Fluids.</note> 
                           <hi>Papers,</hi> you will find examples of the great preſſure that may be ſuſtain'd unharm'd by ſuch frail bodies as Eggs and thin Glaſſes, that one would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſhould be broken in pieces thereby, provided the preſſure be exerciſed by the intervention of an Ambient liquor; as water. And by the account elſewhere refer'd to, of the <hi>Tadpole,</hi> it ſeems highly probable, that even that tender <hi>animal,</hi> when it ſeem'd by ſome ſmall diminution of the bulk to be every way a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd inwards, was put to no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable (or perhaps to any ſenſible) pain or inconvenience, ſince it ſeem'd
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58466:142"/>to ſwim without any irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which would in likelihood have inſued, if it had been much harm'd or incommodated. Which example, with thoſe formerly pointed at, may teach us, that there may be a vaſt difference betwixt the reſiſtance that a body can make when compreſs'd immediately by Solid bodies, &amp; when in the compreſſion every way ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fluids intervene. Which you will the leſs admire, if you conſider, that by reaſon of the groſsneſs, hardneſs, or rigidneſs of viſible Solid bodies the preſſure can never be made every where ſo equally as by the parts of Liquors, whoſe ſmalneſs, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them ſingly inviſible, fits them to accommodate themſelves far more cloſely and conveniently to all the ſuperficial parts of the body immers'd in them, and to have the force of the compreſſing body more uniformly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58466:142"/>diſtributed to them. But becauſe the Inſtances referr'd to, are taken from bodies ſurrounded with water, I will take two or three about the reſiſtance of bodies to violently compreſs'd Air; <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe thoſe made in our Engine are wont to be perform'd with Air (not condens'd, but) rarified or expanded beyond its uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; and <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe it will not be deny'd, that the corpuſcles of Air may be really compreſt or thruſt againſt one another, ſince 'tis clear, that they may be crouded into far leſs room, than they poſſeſs'd before, and bear ſo ſtrongly againſt the Glaſſes that impriſon them, as not ſeldom, if too much compreſs'd, to burſt them in pieces.</p>
                        <p>Conſider then, that among bodies not fluid the Swims of ſmaller fiſhes are likely to be judged none of the moſt able to reſiſt compreſſion, ſince
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58466:143"/>they conſiſt of bladders ſo thin and delicate, that a piece of fine <hi>Venice</hi>-Paper is very thick in compariſon, and that they contain nothing in them but ſoft Air not-compreſs'd by any outward force. I cauſed one of theſe bladders of above an inch in length and proportionably great, to be taken out of a <hi>Roach,</hi> and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with Oyl to keep it ſupple, and preſerve it from being pierced or ſoftened by the water; and having by a weight of Lead, faſtend to the neck of it, let it down to the bottom of a hollow Cylindrical tube, ſeal'd at one end, and made purpoſely large, and about 56 inches long, for ſome Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Experiments; we could not perceive, that by the weight of all the incumbent water it was manifeſtly compreſs'd, or that it did diſcover the leaſt wrinkle or other depreſſion of the very thin membrane,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58466:143"/>though ſtuffed but with Air. And this tryal was made more than once with the ſame ſuceſs; and yet, that this proceeded rather from the robuſtneſs of the bladder, that was able to reſiſt the weight of a taller pillar of water, than from the Non-gravitation of water in the upper part of the tube on that in the lower, we ſhew'd, by preſently letting down ſuch a Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial-Gage as is deſcrib'd, &amp; often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Continuation of our <hi>New Experiments.</hi> For letting down this by a ſtring to the bottom of a tube, the weight of the incumbent water forced up ſome of the Mercury out of the open leg of the <hi>Syphon</hi> into the ſeal'd one, and conſequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd the air included there, which though it were not very much, yet it was very manifeſt. For the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compreſs'd Air being 3 inches and ⅝ in length, we judg'd it at the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58466:144"/>bottom of the tube about ⅝ by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion of the Mercury that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd up; and to ſatisfie my ſelf and others, that, if the incumbent water had been heavy enough, it would have viſibly depreſs'd the bladder in ſpite of any <hi>Principium Hylarchicum,</hi> ſince I could not have a tube long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the bladder was ſunk into a Chryſtal-Glaſs that had a long and Cylindrical neck, and was ſo well ſtuffed with a ſtopple that was Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical too, that 'twas very difficult for any thing to get out betwixt it and the orifice of the Glaſs; then, a competent Quantity of air being left above the water, the ſtopple was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and by degrees thruſt down, and ſo, leſſening the capacity of the Glaſs, compreſs'd the air that was next it, and, by the intervention of that, the water that was under it. And though there did not upon a ſlight compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58466:144"/>of the outward air appear any ſenſible operation upon the <hi>bladder,</hi> that was at the bottom of the water; yet, upon a farther intruſion of the ſtopple the preſſure being encreas'd, the immers'd bladder diſcover'd not only one but two conſiderably deep wrinkles, which preſently diſappear'd upon the drawing up of the ſtopple. Upon whoſe being thruſt in again, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions were again to be ſeen on the Swim. And we having been careful to conveigh into the ſame Glaſs ſuch a Mercurial Gage as has been lately ſpoken of, we eſtimated by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation of the air in the ſeal'd leg of that Gage, that the <hi>bladder</hi> had been expos'd to a preſſure, that might be equivalent to that of a pillar of about 40 foot of water.</p>
                        <p>This I hope will leſſen the wonder, that Bodies of ſo firm a texture as thoſe of <hi>luſty men,</hi> ſhould ſupport
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58466:145"/>the preſſure of the water at ſuch depths, as <hi>Divers</hi> are wont to ſtay at; ſince we ſee, what reſiſtance can be made by ſo exceeding thin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate a membrane ſtuff'd only with air, in compariſon of the ſtrong mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brans and fibres of a man, ſtuff'd beſides Air with more firm parts. I will not here urge, that great weights may be ſuſtain'd in the Air by ſuch <hi>tendons</hi> (or cords of fibres,) and by other fibres, as it were, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven into membrans, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what an ordinary man would expect: But I ſhall invite you to conſider with me, that not only upon the account of the ſtable parts of the humane Body, but of the Spirits too, it may reſiſt very violent preſſures (and ſuch as perhaps have not yet been conſidered) of a fluid Body, not only without any manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſion or diſlocation of parts, but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58466:145"/>without any ſenſe of pain; which I ſuppoſe you will grant me, if, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what great effects Guſts of Wind have upon Dores, Trees, nay Maſts of Ships, blowing them down, nay breaking them; and that yet a man without being extraordinary ſtrong will ſtand againſt the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of ſuch a ſtrong Wind, and walk directly againſt it by vertue of the vigour of his muſcles and ſpirits, without being thrown down or bruis'd by ſo violent a Current of Air as beats upon him, but without ſo much as complaining that he feels any pain; and this, though the Wind that beats againſt him, however it be a fluid Body, yet becauſe it acts as a ſtream, does not uniformly compreſs him, but invade only the fore-part of his Body. Likewiſe, in the lifting up heavy weights by Porters, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers and other luſty men, we may ſee
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58466:146"/>the ſlender tendons of the hands loaded with 100 or 150, or perhaps a far greater number of pounds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having their fibres ſo far com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd or ſtretch'd as to make the lifters complain of pain, though ſometimes they may of difficulty. So that, (as I could, if it were needful, confirm by other Inſtances) a humane Body is an Engine of a much firmer ſtructure than Scholars are wont to take notice of. And here let me add, that I doubt, whether, if the ſtructure of a man were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably (though not perhaps e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually) firm, he would, eſpecially in a deep Sea, be able to bear the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the water, though not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately applyed, without pain. For (to give you one Reaſon more of my not acquieſcing in vulgar reports about Diving,) having ſeveral times convers'd with a man, apt enough
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58466:146"/>both to enquire and obſerve, who got his living by taking up Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack'd goods, he anſwer'd me, when I ask'd him whether he felt any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line preſſure againſt the Drums of his Ears, which are membranes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>t ſo well back'd as thoſe of other parts; that when he ſtai'd at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable depth, as 10 or 12 fathoms, under the ſurface of the Sea, he felt a great pain in both his ears, which often put him to ſhifts to leſſen it; which by his manner of deſcribing it I concluded was from the incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent reſiſtance of the Air, which he acknowledg'd to me he found by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt tokens to be notably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by the Superior water. Which Relation from ſuch a perſon does not only confirm our explication, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe warrant us to doubt, whether the Common Reports that are made concerning Divers be fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58466:147"/>on, without farther Examen and obſervation.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time I ſhall add two or three Experiments more to confirm the reſiſtance, that Animals may make to a great preſſure, when exercis'd by the mediation of a fluid Body And I the rather gave you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this way of making tryals, becauſe it may be alſo helpful to diſcover the reſiſtances of inanimate Bodies, whoſe Shape and Conſiſtence we may chooſe and vary (almoſt at pleaſure) to the preſſure of (totally or in great part) ambient fluids. And if I had been furniſhed with a tube wide enough, and a quantity of Mercury great enough, I might by the way have ſhewn you, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Learned <hi>Doctor More</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuppoſe, that to <hi>Butter</hi> it ſelf even as conſiderable a preſſure may be ſo applyed as not to be able
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58466:147"/>to make it yield thereunto. For on this occaſion I ſhall adde, that I well remember, that, among other tryals to the ſame purpoſe, I cauſed a piece of freſh Butter, about the bigneſs of a ſmall Hen-Egg, to be brought to an irregular ſhape, that, if the compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were ſuch as many would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, the long corners or ſolid angles being at leaſt flatted, the Butter might be reduc'd into a more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious figure and leſs remote from roundneſs. But though having put this lump of Butter into a Bladder, almoſt full of fair water, we proceeded, both in the ſame braſs Cylinder, and much after the ſame manner that I employed about the Egg mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Fourth Experiment of the <hi>Tract of the Differing preſſure of heavy Solids and Fluids;</hi> yet I found, that after the plugg had been loaded with a weight of Lead of above 50 pound,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58466:148"/>neither I, nor the Operator, perceived, the irregular figure of the Butter to be altered. Nor was this the only tryal of this kind I made with the like ſucceſs upon Butter, though I dare not charge my memory with the Circumſtances; and therefore I ſhall without delay proceed to what I was about to recite concerning the Reſiſtance of <hi>Animals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We took then a common <hi>Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlie,</hi> neither of the biggeſt ſort of all, nor of the leaſt, but of a middle ſize, and having put it into the ſhorter leg of a bent Glaſs, which we caus'd to be Hermetically ſeal'd at the end, there was put in as much Mercury as fill'd that leg and a part of the other, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little more than an inch of Air between the Quick-ſilver and the ſeal'd end, that there might be room both for the Fly and the Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air, and then with a little
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58466:148"/>Rammer, fitted for the purpoſe, we caus'd the Mercury in the open leg to be thruſt againſt that in the ſeal'd leg, which thereupon did neceſſarily croud the Air near the Fly into leſs room; ſo that, by our gueſs, it was condenſed into about a third part of the ſpace, which it poſſeſs'd before, and which it regain'd, when the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was withdrawn: And though this were done more than once, yet not only the Fly was thereby not kill'd, but not ſo much, that appear'd, as ſenſibly hurt, and I perceiv'd her, whilſt ſhe was pent up, to move her legs and to rub them one againſt the other, as 'tis uſual with that ſort of Inſects to do of their own accord in the free Air. Nor did I queſtion but that, if the Glaſs had not been inconveniently ſhap'd to admit the Rammer farther into it, the Fly would have ſupported a far greater Preſſure.</p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:58466:149"/>
                        <p>Another Experiment to the ſame purpoſe we try'd with Water inſtead of Mercury; but, whereas this laſt named liquor could neither wet nor drown our Fly, (for which reaſon I chiefly made choice of it,) the other did firſt wet its wings, and ſoon after by a miſchance drown it. But firſt we had an opportunity to compreſs the Air into a third, if not into a fourth part of its former dimenſions, and yet the Fly continued to move divers of her parts and eſpecially her legs very vigorouſly, as if nothing troubled her but her being, as it were, glu'd to the inſide of the Glaſs by part of her wetted wings. And this I hope will keep the Reſiſtance of <hi>Divers</hi> to the Ambient water from ſeeming incredible; ſince ſuch Flyes were able to reſiſt, and (for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd) without harm or pain, the preſſure of the crouded particles of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58466:149"/>the Air; though we gueſs'd this to have been as much compreſs'd by the force of the Rammer, as it would have been by a Gylinder of water of 50 or between 50 and 60 foot high. By which alſo we may be help'd to conceive, how great a difference there is, whether the ſame preſſure be exercis'd by a ſolid or by a fluid Body. For, according to our eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the preſſure againſt the Body of the Fly was as great as if a ſlender pillar of Marble, having the Fly for its Baſe, and 18 or 20 foot in height, had lean'd upon the little <hi>Animal;</hi> which I preſume you will eaſily think was more than enough to cruſh her to Death.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe, though the fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tryals are not like to be rejected by the skilful, yet they require a ſomewhat dextrous and nimble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimenter, and leave ſomething to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58466:150"/>his eſtimate, I will ſubjoyn an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment more eaſie to be made, and wherein the weight may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Meaſure rather than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, being made to be perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly incumbent on the Fly <hi>or other Animal.</hi> For the Experiment may be as well made on <hi>other</hi> Inſects, as Worms, though ſome that I had provided chanc'd to miſcarry before they came to be uſed.</p>
                        <p>We took then ſome ordinary black Flies (ſuch as uſe to haunt Butchers ſtalls in warm ſeaſons,) of a middle ſize, (the length of the Body and Head of one <hi>Animal,</hi> which for trials ſake we meaſured, being about three eights of an inch,) and having pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced one of them with the head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that there was ſome diſtance left bewixt her and the ſealed end of the Glaſs-tube 9 or 10 inches long; we poured in Quick-ſilver very ſlowly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58466:150"/>and cautiouſly, leſt the force of ſo heavy a body, acquired by the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of its deſcent, ſhould more than the meer weight it ſelf of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor oppreſs the Fly. To this effect ſtooping the Glaſs very much towards the <hi>Horizon</hi> and letting the Mercury puſs into the tube through a Funnel, whoſe lower part was very ſlender, that it might come down but by little and little, we at length got in as much Mercury as the tube would receive, and then holding it upright, we watched, whether the Fly would make any motions; and finding, that ſhe did manifeſtly ſtir notwithſtanding the incumbent Mercury, we meaſur'd the height of the Mercurial pillar, reaching from the middle of her body to the top of the liquor, and found it to be about eight inches, and the Quickſilver being poured out, the Fly appear'd to be ſo lively and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58466:151"/>that I doubted not, but if we had had a longer Glaſs, the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been much more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But when afterwards I was able to procure a better tube, the ſeaſon of Flyes being almoſt quite paſt, I could ſcarce get any, and thoſe not brisk, as they are wont to be in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But however we repeated the Experiment with one of the beſt we could take of the above-mentioned ſize, and ordering the matter ſo, that the Mercury incumbent on her, (for there was ſome beneath her,) appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of a greater height than the formerly imployed tube was of, we ſaw her move one or other of her little leggs divers times, though the tube were held upright; and therefore meaſuring the height of the Mercury above her, we found it to amount to 16 inches and better, and then free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from this preſſure, we obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58466:151"/>that ſhe immediately found her leggs again, and moved up and down briskly enough; but when ſhe was loaden with 23 or 24 inches of the ſame Quickſilver (though the liquor were ſoon after poured out) ſhe gave no ſigns of life, which I ſuſpected might happen, not ſo much from her having been oppreſt by the greatneſs of her weight, as from the great care of the Operator to let down the Mercury very obliquely and warily upon her. And this I was the rather confirm'd in, becauſe having got an other Fly of about the ſame bigneſs, though when ſhe was at the bottom of the Quickſilver, ſhe ſeemed ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt as not to have any motion we could take notice of, yet, upon her being taken out of the Glaſs, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appeared to be alive by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about and beginning to diſplay her wings, though the pillar of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58466:152"/>that had leaned upon her, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to above 27 inches. And I preſume, the ſucceſs would have been much more conſiderable, if the Experiment had been tryed in the Summer, when theſe Creatures are brisk and lively, and not as it was in the Winter; beſides that probably theſe little Animals were hurt or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd by the violence that would ſcarce fail to be us'd in catching them, and putting them into ſuch a place and poſture in the Glaſs as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; the actual coldneſs of the Quickſilver perhaps alſo making them ſomewhat torpid, whilſt it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſo many ways. And it muſt not be here omitted, that a Fly, that ſeemed but about half ſo big as one of thoſe hitherto mentioned, being well placed, with ſome Mercury un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, in a Glaſs-pipe held upright, ſuſtained a Mercurial pillar of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58466:152"/>above 25 inches; and though ſhe was not obſerved to move under ſo great a weight, yet when once it was taken off, ſhe did not appear hurt, much leſs cruſh'd to Death by it, and probably would have eſcap'd under a much greater weight, if the tube, which was too large, had not already imployed all the ſtock of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury we then had at hand. But I do preſume, that what we did try will be available to our purpoſe, ſince we ſee clearly, that ſo ſmall an <hi>Animal</hi> as a Fly may ſurvive ſo great a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that ſhe could not only live, but was able to move ſuch long and ſlender Bodies as her leggs, when ſhe was preſſed againſt by above 16 inches of Mercury, and (conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) by a weight equivalent to a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of water of above 18 foot and a half, which being above 590 times her own length, and (according to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58466:153"/>the eſtimate our meaſure ſuggeſted) many times more her own height; ſo that a <hi>Diver,</hi> 6 foot tall, (which is ſomewhat more than an ordinary mans ſtature,) to have as many times his height of water above him, as our Fly might have had and yet have moved under it, muſt dive (at leaſt in freſh water,) to near a hundred fathom, which is a far greater depth (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by 5 or 6 times) than, for ought I could learn by inquiry, the Divers either for Coral or Pearl are wont to deſcend.</p>
                        <p>And now, Sir, having tender'd you the likelieſt conjectures that occurr'd to me about the ſolution of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Problem; I ſhall return to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>More,</hi> and conſider the objection, he frames from the ſuppoſed inſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of it. And on this occaſion I ſhall have two or three things to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you.</p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:58466:153"/>
                        <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that there would be much more weight in what he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, if our Aſſertion of the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of water in water were, like the <hi>Principium Hylarchicum,</hi> a meer Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis advanc'd, without any clear poſitive proof, whereas our Doctrine is not only elſewhere directly proved, by particular Experiments, but by the very controverted one of the <hi>Tadpole;</hi> to elude whoſe force ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious a perſon is fain to flye to a Principle, that, (to ſay <hi>here</hi> no more,) is not Phyſical. And from this firſt of the things I lately mentioned I ſhall haſten to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> becauſe it will require to be longer inſiſted on.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall then further repreſent that whatever power he is pleas'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at the bottom of the Sea to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the impreſſion of the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Water, I think, that ſuppoſition ought to give place, if not to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58466:154"/>Ratiocinations, yet to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it ſelf, which ſhews there really is a great preſſure exercis'd by the Water at the bottom of the Sea. I remember, that a friend of the Learned
<note n="*" place="margin">Sir <hi>R. M.</hi>
                           </note> Doctors and mine, who is ſo eminent a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> as to have been often Preſident of the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> related a while ſince to me, that a Mathematical friend of his, whom he nam'd, having had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to try an Experiment, I have in vain endeavoured to get try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me, had the Curioſity to let down in a deep Sea a Pewter-bottle with weight enough to ſink it, that he might try, whether any ſweet Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would ſtrain in at the orifice or any other part; but when he had pull'd it up again, he was much ſurpriz'd to find the ſides of his Pewter-bottle very much compreſs'd, and, as 'twere, ſqueez'd inward by the Water. I
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58466:154"/>alſo not long ſince inquir'd of an obſerving Acquaintance of mine, that has a conſiderable eſtate in <hi>America,</hi> whether he had not try'd to cool his drink, when he ſail'd through the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> by letting down the bottles to a great depth into the Sea, and, if he did, in what Condition he found them when they were drawn up again. To which he anſwer'd, that he had ſeveral times employ'd that Expedient for the Refrigeration of his Drinks, but was at firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd to find the Corks, with which the ſtrong ſtone-bottles had been well ſtopt before, ſo forcibly and ſo far thruſt in, that they could ſcarce have been ſo violently beaten in with a Hammer, and 'twas ſcarce poſſible to get them out. And an other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Perſon, that practiſes Phyſick in the <hi>Indies,</hi> having the like Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion put to him, anſwer'd me, that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58466:155"/>he had ſome while ſince had the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to try in a very deep part of the Sea, whether any freſh Water would ſtrain into Stone-bottles through a thick Cork ſtrongly ſtopt in, and having let it down with a convenient weight to 100 fathom, was much diſappointed, when he drew it up, by finding that the preſſure of the Water at ſo vaſt a depth had quite thruſt down the Cork into the Cavity of the bottle (which elſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would have been cruſhed to pieces;) an effect which he would ſcarce have expected from the ſtroaks of a Mallet. And if to all this it be objected, that 'twas not the preſſure, but the coldneſs of the Water that did the recited feats by condenſing the included Air, and obliging Nature to do the reſt for fear of a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> I will not lanch into the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, whether Nature do any thing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58466:155"/>
                           <hi>ob fugam Vacui,</hi> but only anſwer, that I cannot find by the Relations of the <hi>Divers</hi> or otherwiſe, that 'tis ever ſo cold at the bottom of the Sea, as 'tis frequently above ground in Winter, when great Fiſhes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid to return to the deep parts of the Sea for warmth, and yet in the ſharpeſt Winters I never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd Corks to be driven in by the cold of the Ambient; nay, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely tryed with a Frigorifick mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that very intenſe degrees of cold, ſuch as would quickly freez many Liquors, would not occaſion the breaking of thin bubbles of Glaſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely blown at the flame of a Lamp and hermetically ſealed.</p>
                        <p>And to ſhew <hi>ad oculum</hi> (as they ſpeak) that Water may preſs more and more, as it grows deeper, againſt the ſtopple of a Bottle, though the Veſſel be inverted, I will ſubjoyn
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58466:156"/>this Experiment. Becauſe we have no Water hereabouts that is near deep enough to force in a Cork, as the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water did in the above recited tryals, I thought of a way of ſo cloſing the Glaſs-veſſel, as that the ſtopple ſhould keep aſunder the Air in the Veſſel and the outward Water, and hinder all immediate intercourſe between them, and alſo make ſome reſiſtance againſt the preſſure of the external Water, and yet be capable of freely moving up and down, and ſo be a good <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneum</hi> to a ſolid ſtopple. Taking then a Glaſs-Vial, furniſhed with a (ſomewhat long) Cylindrical neck, whoſe Cavity was large in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reſt of the Veſſel, we put into it as much Quickſilver as would in the neck make a ſhort Mercurial Pillar of between half an inch and an inch; then, a piece of very fine Bladder, dipp'd in Oil, was ſo tyed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58466:156"/>over the orifice of the Glaſs, that no Mercury could fall down or get out, nor Water get in at the orifice, and yet the Bladder, by reaſon of its great limberneſs, might be eaſily thruſt up towards the Cavity of the Vial, or depreſs'd by the weight of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. This little inſtrument, firſt furniſhed with a weight of Lead to ſink it, being inverted, the Mercury deſcended into the neck, and cloſed the orifice as exactly as a ſtopple, and yet with its lower part depreſs'd the Bladder beneath the Horizontal Plane, that might be conceiv'd to paſs by the orifice; then the Glaſs, being a while kept in the Water, (that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air might be brought to the Temperature of the ſurrounding Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,) and by a ſtring let further down into the ſame Glaſs-veſſel fill'd to about two foot in height, the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Liquor againſt the orifice
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58466:157"/>of the Vial did by degrees drive up the Bladder and the Mercurial ſtopple into the cavity of the Neck, as was manifeſt by the aſcenſion of the Quickſilver; and when the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was leiſurely drawn up again, the weight of this Mercury made it ſubſide and plump up the Bladder again as before. An Experiment akin to this, and therefore fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, I have deliver'd in another
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox about Suction.</note> Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>And here I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn what very opportunely occurr'd to me ſince the writing of the laſt page. Meeting caſually with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Mechanician, (whom you will find I have
<note n="*" place="margin">In the <hi>Tract</hi> of <hi>the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Preſſure of heavy Solids and Fluids.</hi>
                           </note> elſewhere mentioned) that deviſed a ſuit of cloaths and other accommodations, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I once ſaw him let down into the Water,) by whoſe help and that of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58466:157"/>a boat he could (and did) continue there a great while at a conſiderable depth under water, and there work; I ask'd him afreſh (to obtain fuller informations than formerly) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he felt not the preſſure of the water againſt his breaſt and belly, to which he anſwer'd me (more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially than he had before) that when he was about 4 or 5 yards under water, though but in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Thames,</hi> his breaſt and <hi>abdomen</hi> was ſo compreſt, that there being hardly room enough left for the free motion of his Lungs he could ſcarce fetch his breath, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to make them draw him quickly up, and that (among his later tryals to improve his Engine) having for remedy hereof, cauſed a kind of Armour for the Cheſt and back to be made of Copper, though the ſtiffneſs of the Metal defended
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58466:158"/>him from receiving any miſchief in thoſe parts, yet in the others, where only the Leather, though ſtrong, was interpoſed, when he came to the depth of about ſix fathom, though in freſh water, he found a great preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt his legs and armes and all the other parts againſt which the water was able to thruſt the Leathern ſuit inwards. And this preſſure being found by him, as he told me, pretty equal (againſt all the expoſed parts, for from the other, which were more yielding and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, the Armour kept it off,) he received no Miſchief from it, not yet <hi>much</hi> Incommodity (and <hi>ſome</hi> he might expect from the ſtiffneſs and unequal yielding of the Leather;) ſo that he could ſtay under water, though not ſtill at ſo great a depth, about 2 hours or longer. And upon the whole matter he anſwered me, that he was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58466:158"/>well ſatisfied by his tryals, that the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient water endeavoured to preſs him &amp; his Diving ſuit every way inwards. Whether the coldneſs of the water had any intereſt in this <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> I particularly enquired of the Engineer; but he replyed, that by reaſion of the tightneſs of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuit or inſtrument, the warm ſteams of his body that were pent in, and other concurring circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances kept him from feeling any cold, and made him ſometimes feel a greater Heat than he wiſhed. He has promiſed me before it be very long to make for me a tryal or two that I propounded to him, from whoſe ſucceſs, if he can but reduce them to Experiment, I hope to be able to preſent you a farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our Hypotheſis. In the mean time, the things already recited, together with the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58466:159"/>Experiments, may well ſuffice for our preſent purpoſe. For, by what hath been ſaid it appears, that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter does actually preſs againſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whether ſpecifically lighter or heavier than it ſelf, placed under water, and that this preſſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes with the height of the water above the immerſed Bodies. And this being ſo, it is not more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me than for men of other Opinions to give a clear reaſon why <hi>Divers</hi> can reſiſt ſo great a preſſure of the incumbent water. And the preſſure of the water in our recited Experiment having manifeſt effects upon Inanimate bodies, which are not capable of prepoſſeſſions or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us partial informations, will have much more weight with unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced perſons, than the ſuſpicious and ſometimes diſagreeing accounts of ignorant <hi>Divers,</hi> whom preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58466:159"/>opinions may much ſway, and whoſe very ſenſations, as thoſe of other vulgar men, may be influenced by Prediſpoſitions and ſo many other Circumſtances, that they may eaſily give occaſion to miſtakes. I know, that Learned men, that never were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in Hydroſtaticks, are wont to think it very difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to conceive, how ſo weak a thing, as they fancy an <hi>Animal</hi> to be, ſhould avoid the being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd or ſo much as harmed by ſo great a weight of Water. But they that ſhall attentively conſider what has been offer'd towards the removal of this difficulty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how little they would have believed, that there is ſo great a difference, as we have by the Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole, the Fly and other inſtances, ſhewn there really is between the preſſure of Solid and of Fluid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58466:160"/>will, I preſume, be apt to think it fit, that, if for want of a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hiſtory of matters of fact any ſcruple remain about the Solution we have offer'd from the nature of the Uniform preſſure of Fluids, and the Firm ſtructure of the Humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; we ſhould, to remove thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſcruples alſo, rather range about for other Phyſical helps to ſolve more compleatly the Problem, about ſuch a thing as Compreſſion, which is an action purely Corporeal and Mechanical, than for want of a ready and compleat Solution to flye to the immediate interpoſition of an immaterial and intelligent yet Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Agent, to explain clearly whoſe manner of working would be a much more difficult Task, than the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Phaenomenon without it.</p>
                        <p>And now, Sir, having preſented
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58466:160"/>to you the Reflections I thought requiſite to write upon the Learned Doctors diſcourſes againſt my Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis and Explications, relating to the gravitation and preſſure of Fluids, I have little more to trouble you with in this Paper. For, though in the latter part of the 13th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Doctor is pleaſed to ſpend divers pages in the Explication of divers of my Hydroſtatical Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena by the Agency of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Director, that he calls <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium Hylarchicum;</hi> yet ſince theſe Explications of his are rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to accommodate the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> to the Hypotheſis, than ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections directly levell'd againſt my Solutions, I ſhall altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to examine them; the main thing that I intended in this Paper, according to what I told you at the beginning, being to ſhew, that the

I leave it therefore to you, Sir, to judge which of the two ways, of explicating an Hydroſtatical Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon, the Learned Doctors, or that which I have made uſe of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes moſt of the Naturaliſt. And I ſhall only tell you, that if I had
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58466:162"/>been with thoſe Jeſuites, that are ſaid to have preſented the firſt watch to the King of <hi>China,</hi> who took it to be a living Creature, I ſhould have thought I had fairly account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, if, by the ſhape, ſize, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. of the Spring-wheels, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and other parts of the watch I had ſhewn, that an Engine of ſuch a ſtructure would neceſſarily mark the hours, though I could not have brought an argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Chineſe-Monarch, that it was not endowed with Life. From which compariſon you will eaſily gather, that what I have thought my ſelf concern'd to doe in this place, was not to demonſtrate in general, that there can be no ſuch thing as the Learned Doctors <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium Hylarchicum,</hi> but only to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that, whether there be or not, our Hydroſtaticks do not need it.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58466:162"/>Nor do I think it neceſſary to the Doctors grand and laudable deſign, (wherein I heartily wiſh him much ſucceſs) of proving the exiſtence of an Incorporeal ſubſtance. For as I think, Truth ought to be pleaded for only by Truth; ſo I take that, which the Doctor contends for, to be evincible in the righteſt way of proceeding by a perſon of far leſs learning than He, without introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any precarious Principle; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially experience having ſhewn, that the generality of Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were convinc'd of the being of a divine Architect of the World, by the contemplation of ſo vaſt and admirably contriv'd a Fabrick, wherein yet taking no notice of an immaterial <hi>Principium Hylarchicum,</hi> they believed things to be managed in a meer Phyſical way according
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58466:163"/>to the General Laws ſetled among things Corporeal, acting upon one another. And after this I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to ſay, but that I would not have any thing that I have ſaid miſconſtrued to the Learned Doctors prejudice. For 'tis nor neceſſary, that a great Scholar ſhould be a good Hydroſtatician. And a few hallucinations about a ſubject, to which the greateſt Clerks have been generally ſuch ſtrangers, may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us to diſſent from his opinion, without obliging us to be enemies to his Reputation. And therefore if you have found any thing in this Paper inconſiſtent with a juſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of that, you have not only my conſent, but my deſire to alter it, as an Expreſſion, that doth not well comply with my Intentions of not appearing any farther his

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>CAlling this night in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard for the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Rays</hi> Travels, that you yeſterday commended to me, I was alſo ſhewn a New Treatiſe, that I never ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of a Learned Gentleman, and haſtily running over the <hi>Index,</hi> found an Experiment of mine declared In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58466:167"/>and <hi>though,</hi> being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to make haſt home, it be ſo late, that far from having time to peruſe the book it ſelf, (which I tell you, that you may not now expect any Character of it from me,) I have been ſcarce able to read over, more than once, what directly concerns me in it; <hi>yet</hi> I ſhall adventure to ſay ſomething about it this night, for fear I ſhould not, in ſo buſie a time as this, be allowed to do it to morrow.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then the Learned Objector having recited my experiment about weighing Water in Water, as you were pleaſed to publiſh it in a book enriched with ſo many better things, the
<note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>Philoſophical Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> begins his animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion with ſaying that <hi>herein is a great miſtake.</hi> I ſhall not in that much oppoſe him: For poſſibly the Diſpute between us is not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58466:167"/>much more than verbal. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Experiment coming abroad by it ſelf, and ſuppoſing things that I had formerly proved, and publiſhed, but which were not expreſly referr'd to in it, I wonder not that my meaning ſhould not by all Readers be fully underſtood. And therefore, to explain my ſelf on this occaſion, give me leave both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat my Opinion, and to ſhew you, on what occaſion and how far I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to confirm it by this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. My opinion then was, and ſtill is, that as water is a heavy fluid, ſo it does retain its Gravitation and power of preſſing; by which I mean a tendency downwards (whatever the cauſe of that gravity be,) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it have under it a body either ſpecifically heavier or lighter than it ſelf or equiponderant to it. For I ſee not what ſhould deſtroy or
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58466:168"/>aboliſh this Gravity, though many things may hinder ſome effects of it. And therefore I ſuppoſe, that Water retains its Gravity not only in Air but in Water too, and in heavier liquors, and conſequently, by vertue of this, the liquor preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon them; but if a ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fluid have, upon the ſcore of its ſpecifick Gravity, an equal or a ſtronger tendency downwards than water, it will, by vertue of that, be able to impel up this liquor or to keep it from actually deſcending: ſo that a portion of water, ſuppoſed to be included in a Veſſel of the ſame ſpecifick weight with water, this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſay, placed in a greater Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the ſame water will neither riſe nor fall, as I have elſewhere ſhewn; but yet it retains its Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there, only this Gravity is kept from making it actually deſcend by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58466:168"/>the contrary action of the other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe ſpecifick Gravity is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed equal; as when a juſt bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance is loaded with a pound weight in each of its ſcales, though neither of the weights actually deſcend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hinder'd by its counterpoiſe, yet each retains its whole weight, and with it preſſes the ſcale it leans upon; ſo that our lately mentioned included portion of water does real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>preſs</hi> the ſubjacent water, though it does not actually <hi>depreſs</hi> it, or, (as perhaps a School-man would phraſe it) does <hi>gravitate</hi> on it but not <hi>pregravitate.</hi> Nor do I think, that the only way of judging, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a body gravitates, is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whether it <hi>actually</hi> deſcends, ſince in many caſes its Gravity may be proved by the Reſiſtance it makes to heavy bodies, which, if it were not one, would raiſe it: As may be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58466:169"/>declar'd by what I juſt now noted about equal weights in a ballance: And for want of this diſtinction I have known even learned men, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hydroſtatical things, miſtake both me and the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I had to tell you, is, that the Adverſaries, I had to deal with both in Print and in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, denyed, that in (ſtanding) Water, the upper parts did preſs or gravitate upon the lower; and though they could not but grant, that the whole weight of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did gravitate upon the bottom of the Veſſel; yet they would have the parts of it to do ſo <hi>actione com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni</hi> (as they ſpeak) and fancied I know not what power of Nature to keep the homogeneous portions of Water, as well as other Elements, from preſſing one another, when it is in its proper place. Againſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58466:169"/>this Opinion, (which I preſume my Learned Adverſary and I agree in oppoſing,) it was alledged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other things, which I found many, otherwiſe good, Scholars were not fitted to underſtand, That if a Glaſs-vial or bottle, well ſtopt, were deeply immerſed under water, it would ſtrongly tend upwards; but if it were dextrouſly unſtop'd, when 'twas thus immers'd, ſo as the water could get in, abſtracting from or allowing for the weight of the Glaſs it ſelf, 'twould by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that crouds in and thruſts out the Air, be made ſtrongly to tend downwards and continue ſunk. But this not ſatisfying, becauſe 'twas pretended, that the reaſon of the empty bottles emerging when ſtopt was the poſitive Levity of the Air it was filled with, and the ſinking
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58466:170"/>of it, when unſtopt, was from the receſs of the ſame Air, that by the intruding Water was driven with large bubbles out of the bottle; I thought this evaſion might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated by contriving an Experiment, wherein the Water ſhould be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully and ſuddenly admitted into the Glaſs, and yet no Air expelled out of it, (which Circumſtance I therefore took notice of, where I ſay, <hi>no bubble of Air appear'd to emerge or eſcape through the water,)</hi> ſo that, if then the Glaſs that was kept up before ſhould fall to the bottom with a gravitation amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a conſiderable weight in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its capacity, the ſinking of it could not by them be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as before, to the receſs of the Air, endowed, as they ſuppoſe, with poſitive Levity, but to the weight
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58466:170"/>of the admitted Water, which, when thus weighed, would be inviron'd with Water of the ſame kind: And to ſhew, that this admitted Water might have a conſiderable weight not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the place it was in, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed a pair of ſcales after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that is recited in the Experiment.</p>
                  <p>By what I have been diſcourſing, you may conceive, that, however my expreſſions diſagree with thoſe of my Adverſary, the diſtance of our opinions is not ſo wide as at firſt ſight it ſeems. For he allows as well as I, that the ſuperiour parts of Water do by their Gravity, (for I know not on what other ſcore they can do it,) preſs the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. But this he would not have amount to this expreſſion, <hi>that water weighs</hi> or gravitates <hi>in water;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I ſcruple not to cloath my ſence
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58466:171"/>in that expreſſion, becauſe I think, water does always exerciſe its gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, though it does not always <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravitate</hi> or <hi>actually</hi> deſcend, being often (as I noted above) either impell'd up by an oppoſite and prepollent weight, or hinder'd from deſcending by the Reſiſtance of other water that counterpoiſes it: ſo that, if he thinks, that in my Experiment I meant to propoſe a method of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Water deſcend in Water, and weigh it in that Liquor with a pair of ſcales, <hi>juſt</hi> as if I would weigh in the ſame Water a piece of Lead or a portion of Mercury, which are bodies much heavier <hi>in ſpecie</hi> than Water, either he miſtakes my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or I did not ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. But that which I deſigned to ſhew, and, for ought I can yet ſee, have ſhewn, was, that <hi>by the help
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58466:171"/>of an ordinary ballance,</hi> it may be made appear, that Water admitted into the Glaſs-bubble, I imployed, did make the Glaſs-bubble weigh ſo much heavier than it did before that Liquor enter'd into it; and that this new weight, that was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ballance, was not due, as my Adverſary ſuppoſed, to ſuch a receſs of the Air as I mention'd a while ago.</p>
                  <p>And now, Sir, It will be proper to take notice of ſome paſſages in the Objectors Diſcourſe, in order to dilucidate the ſubject of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſayes (page the 149. &amp; 150.) <hi>Take a piece of wood, that is lighter</hi> in ſpecie <hi>than Water, and add weight to it by degrees, till it become of the ſame weight with Water; knit it with a ſtring to a ballance, and weigh it in Water, and you will find
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58466:172"/>the whole weight ſupported by the water.</hi> I anſwer, that this does not at all overthrow my opinion, but agrees very well with it. For, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the weight you add to the light wood be Lead, it cannot be ſaid, that the Metal loſes its native ponderoſity whilſt it reſts in the Water; and the reaſon, why it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends not, is, that it and the wood, it is joyn'd to, are hinder'd by the counterpoiſe of the Collateral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by its preſſure would raiſe the ſurface of the Water, whereon the floating or ſwimming body leans, if it were not hinder'd by the weight of theſe incumbent Solids: And this Reſiſtance of theirs to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour upwards of the Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exerciſed only upon the account of their Gravity, ſhews that they do in my ſence <hi>gravitate</hi> (though not <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravitate.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:58466:172"/>
                  <p>Again, if you pleaſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the caſe, put by the Objector (page the 151.) and caſt your eyes upon his Scheme, which, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing you to have his book) I ſhall for brevities ſake make uſe of at preſent; you will find him thus argue.
<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. page 151.</note> 
                     <hi>Now, I ſay, 'tis ſix ounces of the weight (B) that makes this alteration, and turns the ſcales: For, if 12 ounces ſink the Glaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Water, when it is full of Air and no Water in it, then ſurely ſix are ſufficient to ſink it when it is half full. And the reaſon is, becauſe there is a leſs</hi> potentia <hi>or force in 6 inches of Air by the one half to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe a weight of</hi> 12 <hi>ounces, than in</hi> 12 <hi>inches of Air. Therefore this Air being reduc'd from</hi> 12 <hi>inches to ſix, it muſt take only 6 ounces to ſink it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:58466:173"/>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, that I know not yet, what, on this occaſion, he means by a <hi>potentia</hi> or force in 6 inches of Air to counterpoiſe a weight of 12 ounces. For by the term <hi>counterpoiſe,</hi> where the Queſtion is about Weighing, one would think he ſpeaks of Weight; and yet Air, according to the vulgar Opinion, is poſitively light; according to us; though it have a gravity, yet in our caſe that muſt amount to ſo little, that what Air the bubble needed to fill it, could not weigh at moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 4 or 5 grains, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might ſafely be neglected. But, according to my opinion, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without medling with the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia</hi> of the Air. For, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a horizontal Plane to divide the Water mentally, and paſs by
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58466:173"/>the bottom of the ſuſpended bubble; before the little ſtem be taken off, there is a far greater preſſure upon the other parts of that Plane than upon that which lies under the bubble, in regard they are preſt by the weight of the Collateral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>(A, L, G, D, M, C,)</hi> whereas the other is preſt only by the weight of a body very much lighter than its equal bulk of water: ſo that, to keep the bubble from being forcibly buoyed up, there was requiſite 18 ounces of Lead that make up the Plummet <hi>(B)</hi> to detain it under Water, and keep the beam of the ballance Horizontal; that when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is given (at <hi>C)</hi> to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Water, it is by the weight of the collaterally ſuperiour Water im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd into the cavity of the bubble, where the Air, being much rarified
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58466:174"/>before, could not reſiſt its ingreſs, and thereupon 6 ounces of Water getting in, that part of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Plane, on which the bubble was incumbent, is preſt by a greater weight than formerly by 6 ounces, and conſequently there needs the like weight in the oppoſite ſcale of the ballance, to reduce the ſcale to an <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi> And if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with our Author, the Glaſs to be compleatly full of Water, and the counterpoiſe in the ſcale <hi>(O)</hi> to need 6 ounces more to make a new <hi>Aequipondium,</hi> the account of the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> will be the ſame, as, if you attentively conſider it, you will clearly perceive. And the reaſon, why the additional weight of 6 ounces is required, will be, that the upper half of the bubble, that before contained leſs than three or
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58466:174"/>four grains weight of the Air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now fill'd with Water, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſix ounces more of Water than formerly, and ſo the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe in the oppoſite ſcale <hi>(O)</hi> will need the weight of ſix ounces to make a new <hi>Aequipondium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Congruouſly to this explication when the Examiner ſays,
<note n="*" place="margin">page 132.</note> 
                     <hi>Now I inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe</hi> 18 <hi>ounces are the Aequipondium of the Water within the Glaſs or of the weight of the Lead (B)? 'Tis impoſſible they can counterpoiſe both, ſeeing the Water is now</hi> 12, <hi>and B</hi> 18. <hi>It muſt then either be the counterballance of the Water or the counterballance of the Lead. It cannot be the firſt, becauſe</hi> 12 <hi>cannot be in Aequipondio with</hi> 18; <hi>it muſt then be in the ſecond: Or if theſe</hi> 18 <hi>ounces in the ſcale (O) be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58466:175"/>the counterpoiſe of the Water within the Glaſs, I inquire what ſuſtains the weight of the Lead (B)? The weight of it cannot be ſuſtained by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe 'tis a body naturally heavier than Water; it muſt therefore be ſuſtained by the ballance.</hi> I anſwer, that this ſpecious objection ſeems (for it is ſomewhat obſcurely worded) to be founded upon a miſtake of my meaning in the Queſtion. However, as to the Phaenomenon it ſelf; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ſence the 18 ounces in the ſcale <hi>(O)</hi> are the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe of the 18 ounces that hang from the oppoſite and aequidiſtant Scale and make up the Leaden Plummet <hi>(B,)</hi> (which anſwer I ſee not how our Author prevents.) But then you will ask, what counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſes the Water in the bubble, which alone weighs 12 ounces? I
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58466:175"/>anſwer, that 'tis the gravitation of the collateral Water, which preſſes the other parts of the lately mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed imaginary Plane, as much as the Water in the bubble, the weight of the Glaſs being here not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd by either of us; and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incumbent on the bubble does preſs that part of the Plane on which they lean; ſo that there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all 30 ounces to be ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the 18 of the Plummet and the 12 contained in the Glaſs, the Lead that hangs in the Water is counterpoiſed by 18 ounces in the ſcale, and the Water in the bubble by the preſſure of the Collateral Water.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not, that the included Water preſſes at all, ſince it does not at all deſcend. To which I anſwer,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58466:176"/>that as long as the Water was get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Cavity of the bubble, ſo long it did manifeſtly gravitate upon the ſubjacent Plane, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually deſcend, raiſing the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe in the ſcale: But when, by adding more weight to that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe, things are brought to a new <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the gravitation of the VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould again change the now regain'd <hi>Aequipondium.</hi> Suppoſe in the two ſcales of a ballance there were placed two equally capacious and equiponderant Vials, whereof one is <hi>quite</hi> full and the other <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi> full; 'tis evident, that the full Veſſel will keep the ſcale it lean'd upon depreſt, and, if you gently pour in as much VVater into the unfill'd as the fill'd has more than it, the ſcale, that was formerly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58466:176"/>kept rais'd, will be now depreſt, till the beam be brought to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal; to which poſture when it is once brought, the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> will continue: And yet it will not be ſaid, that though the added VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whilſt it was filling the Glaſs, depreſt the ſcale it belonged to, yet it loſt its weight, or, which in my ſence is all one, did not gravitate upon the Scale, when the ballance was come to an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then this VVater did no longer depreſs it. And how much the VVater in our bubble does, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its immerſion, gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, would be viſible, if by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it were all annihilated, and no other ſuffer'd to ſupply its room. For, then the ſubjacent part of the imaginary Plane being much leſs preſt than immediately before, the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58466:177"/>weight of the collaterally ſuperiour VVater would ſtrongly impell up the bubble, if it were not kept in its place by a proportionable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of weight to the Plummet. Nor ſhould it ſeem a ſtrange thing that I ſhould ſay, that the 30 oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, lately mentioned, ſhould be counterballanced partly by the weight in the oppoſite Scale, and partly by the VVater that fills the immers'd bubble, ſince this notion may be warranted even by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice of weighing heavy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids Hydroſtatically. For if you would, <hi>for inſtance,</hi> weigh a lump of Copper of 9 pound in common VVater, the Metal, hanging by a Horſe-hair under VVater, will need, according to my elſewhere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Experiments, either juſt or near about 8 pound in the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58466:177"/>Scale to keep the ballance ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal, ſo that the whole 9 pound, that the lump weighed in the Air, is counterpoiſed partly by the 8 pound newly mention'd in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Scale, and partly by the weight, or reſiſtance following from weight, of as much of the VVater as the Copper fills the room of; which, as experience ſhews, is one pound: And if we ſhould conceive VVater in a Veſſel adiapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as to Gravity and Levity to be ſubſtituted in the place of the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line lump, it would weigh as much as the ninth part of the Copper-lump weighed in the Air, and the ſame counterpoiſe of eight pound would maintain the <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi>

                  <p>What the Learned Objector has at the cloſe of his Diſcourſe about the natural and artificial ballance, could not without prolixity, and

And ſince 'tis in the ſence of this laſt expreſſion, that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58466:178"/>if I miſtake him not, ſpeaks of weighing in VVater, his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that VVater cannot weigh in VVater, does not contradict me, who affirm not that VVater does <hi>ſo</hi> weigh in VVater. VVhether we ſhall agree in all other points of Hydroſtaticks, you will eaſily believe that I cannot yet tell, though by the expreſſion he is pleaſed to uſe (in the 146. page) to uſher in his Objection with, 'tis probable we may. And as to the now diſpatch'd debate, if I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome words in another ſence than he, I preſume he is ſo equitable as to conſider, that I did not write of theſe things after having ſeen this book of his, but ſome years before, and have ſince found thoſe expreſſions juſtified by the uſe, that eminent VVriters have thought fit to make of them. And however I am glad,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58466:179"/>that he has given me this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of clearing my Experiment, and declaring by examples as well as words the opinion it relates to; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if it ſeems to others that I omitted to expreſs my ſelf ſo fully; my deſign being, as I formerly told you, to convince ſuch Adverſaries, as I then had met with, by ſhewing, that the above-recited <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Emerſion and Sinking of a Glaſs-Vial, depended upon the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the VVater, and not upon the poſitive Levity of the Air.</p>

                  <p>'TIs obvious, even to the Vulgar as well as to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, that if Wood, Wax, or another body that is lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi> than water, and naturally floats upon it, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under water, it will upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of that force emerge to the top. And this it does ſo readily, and, as it ſeems ſpontaneouſly, that not only the Peripatetick Schools, but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Philoſophers both ancient and modern, do as well as the Vulgar
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58466:182"/>aſcribe this aſcention of lighter bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in water to an internal principle, which they therefore call <hi>Poſitive Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this Principle was not always ſo univerſally receiv'd among Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, as in later ages it proved to be, <hi>Democritus</hi> and ſeveral of the Antients both Atomiſts and others, admitting no abſolute but only a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative or reſpective Levity, which opinion ſome of the Moderns have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly attempted to revive.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe whatever wit they may have imploy'd in arguing; yet the Schools ſeem to have the advantage in point of Experience, the obvious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, given by the Peripateticks, having neither been ſolv'd by real and practical variations of the ſame inſtances, nor counterballanc'd by new Experiments of a contrary ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; the importance and difficulty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58466:182"/>of the ſubject invited me to attempt, when I was upon Hydroſtatical try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, whether I could experimentally ſhew, that whatever becomes of the general Queſtion about Poſitive Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, we need not admit it for the true and adaequate cauſe of the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Wood and ſuch lighter bodies, let go under water.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="experiment">
                     <head>EXPER. I.</head>
                     <p>THe inſtance that is wont to be urg'd to prove the Poſitive Levity of Wood in Water, ſeems to me to have been too perfunctorily made to be ſafely acquieſced in. For even as it is propos'd with advantage by a learned forreign Mathematician, I cannot think it accurate enough to determine the preſent Controverſie:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58466:183"/>for I will readily allow him to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in caſe a flat board, as for inſtance a Trencher, have its broad ſurface kept by a mans hand or other competent force upon the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bottom of a Tub full of water, if the hand or other body that detain'd it be remov'd, it will ordinarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that the Trencher will haſtily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the ſurface of the water. But I do not perceive, that a deciſive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of this kind is eaſie (not to ſay, poſſible) to be made with ſuch materials. For the wood, whereof both the Trencher and the bottom of the Barrel conſiſt, are ſuppos'd to be lighter <hi>in specie</hi> than Water; and to be ſo, they muſt be of a porous and not very cloſe texture. To which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees very well, that the ſolider woods, as <hi>Lignum Vitae,</hi> Braſil, &amp;c. whoſe texture is more cloſe and compact, will not float on water but ſink in it:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58466:183"/>And therefore, if there be not much more care us'd, than I have yet heard that any Experimenter has imploy'd, to bring the ſurfaces of the Trencher and the bottom of the Barrel to a true flatneſs and as much ſmoothneſs as they can be brought to, I ſhall not think the tryal ſo accurately made as it might be; not to ſay, which I ſuſpect, that though it be mentally, yet it is ſcarce practically poſſible to bring ſuch porous bodies as thoſe of the lighter woods to be fit for ſuch a contact as might be neceſſary to make the tryal accurately. And in caſe that were actually done, I ſhould be kept from expecting with my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries the emerſion of the Trencher, by the Experiment by and by to be recited, and by the true reaſon of it.</p>
                     <p>I think then that the cauſe, why in ordinary inſtances, Wood, Wax, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58466:184"/>other bodies ſpecifically lighter than water, being let go at the bottom of a veſſel full of that liquor, emerge to the top, is chiefly, that there is no ſuch exquiſite congruity and contact between the lowermoſt ſuperficies of the Wood, and the upper ſurface of the bottom of the Veſſel, but that the lateral parts of the Water, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the weight of the parts of the ſame liquor incumbent on them, are made to inſinuate and get between the lower parts of the Wood and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſel, and ſo lift or thruſt upwards the Wood, which bulk for bulk is leſs heavy than the Water that extrudes it.</p>
                     <p>That this is the reaſon of the Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or aſcenſion of bodies, lighter <hi>in specie</hi> than the fluids they ſwim in, is moſt conſonant to the Laws of
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Paradoxes.</note> Hydroſtaticks, as I have elſewhere ſhown. But
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58466:184"/>whereas the whole force of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe I diſpute with, conſiſts in a ſuppoſition, that, becauſe the Trencher (formerly ſpoken of) is plac'd upon the bottom of the Barrel, no water can come between to buoy it up, whence they conclude it muſt aſcend by an internal and poſitive principle of Levity, I thought fit to make the Experiment after another, and, if I miſtake not, a better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>We took then two round plates of Black Marble ſhap'd like Cheeſes, which had thoſe ſuperficies, that were to be clap'd together, ground very flat and poliſh'd very carefully, that the ſtones being laid one upon the other might touch in as many of the ſuperficial parts, as the workman could bring them to do; that, whilſt they were in that poſition, the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt being taken up, the other would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58466:185"/>ſtick to it, and aſcend with it. And to keep out the water the better, the internal ſurfaces were, before they were put together, lightly, and but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lightly, oyl'd, which did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from moſt eaſily ſliding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long one another, either forward or backwards, or to the right, or to the left, as long as the contiguous ſurfaces were kept Horizontal.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being done, a blown Bladder of a moderate ſize was faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the upper marble, and both of them were let down to the bottom of a tub of water, where, by the help of an eaſie contrivance, the lower mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was kept level to the Horizon. And now the Patrons of Poſitive Levity would have concluded, that the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being a body, granted to be by vaſt odds lighter than wood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an unnatural place beneath the ſurface of the water, ſhould of its
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58466:185"/>own accord and with impetuoſity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge; but I expected a contrary event, becauſe the bladder being tied to the upper marble, ſo that both of them might in our caſe be conſidered as one body, the water could not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them up, in regard that the cloſe contact of the ſurfaces of the two mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles kept the water from being able to inſinuate it ſelf between them, and conſequently from getting under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the upper marble, and preſſing againſt the lower ſuperficies of it. And to ſhew that this was the reaſon of the bladders not emerging, I caus'd one of the by-ſtanders to thruſt his arm down to the bottom of the tub, and with his hand to make part of the oyl'd ſurface of the upper marble ſlide off, on any ſide, from that of the lower, which, by reaſon of the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſlipperineſs of the ſurfaces, he found moſt eaſie to do. But the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58466:186"/>contact ſtill continuing according to a greater part of the ſurfaces than was requiſite, I bid him yet ſlide, but by ſlow degrees, more and more of the upper marbles from the lower, till at length, when, according to his gueſs, the marbles touch'd but in one half of their ſurfaces, the endeavour of the water to extrude the bladder full of Air being ſtronger than the reſiſtance, which the contact but of part of the ſurfaces of the ſtones was able to make, they were ſuddenly diſ-joyn'd, and the bladder was by the extruding water impetuouſly, as it were, ſhot up, not only to the top of the water, but a good way beyond it.</p>
                     <p>With theſe Marbles we made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Experiments of this kind, moſt commonly letting down the Marbles both together; but once or twice at leaſt placing the upper Marble under water upon the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58466:186"/>already fixed to the bottom of the barrel.</p>
                     <p>That 'twas not the weight of the upper Marble, nor want of Lightneſs, whether poſitive or relative, of the Air included in the bladder, that kept it from aſcending, was plain, not only by the newly mention'd impetuous emerſion of it, upon the diſ-joyning of the Marbles, but by this, that the Bladder would lift up from the lower parts of the water, not only the upper ſtone when it touch'd not the other, but a weight of ſeven or eight pound hanging at it.</p>
                     <p>And that a <hi>Fuga Vacui</hi> was not an adequate cauſe of the coheſion of the Marbles in our Experiment, may be argued from this, that whether or no nature do any thing at any time out of abhorrence of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> (which may be much diſputed;) yet in our caſe this abhorrency could not be well
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58466:187"/>pleaded by its Aſſertors, ſince many of them hold it to be unlimited, and the more modeſt, to be at leaſt capable of lifting up prodigious weights; whereas in our Experiment the Levity of a Bladder, that could not raiſe ten pound weight, was ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the marbles when they yet touch'd one another according to half their ſurfaces.</p>

                     <p>TO ſhew now whether it is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gravity and Preſſure of the Water, or other ambient fluid, than the Poſitive Levity of a body lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi> than it, that makes the immers'd body aſcend to the ſurface of the liquor, I devis'd this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58466:187"/>
                     <p>We took a bladder out of which a great part of the included Air had been expreſs'd, and tying the neck of it very cloſe, that none of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Air might get out, we faſtned to it a conſiderable weight of ſome very ponderous body, as Lead or Iron. By the help of this we ſunk the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the bottom of a wide mouth'd glaſs, full of water, that the ſurface of the liquor might be a good deal high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the upper part of the bladder: This wide mouth'd glaſs we included in a great Receiver (whoſe orifice muſt be very large to be able to admit ſuch a veſſel;) which I caus'd to be carefully cemented on to the Engine. The main ſcope of this Experiment was to ſhew, that though the Air, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the bladder, was very far from being able by its abſolute levity to lift up ſo great a weight as the bladder was clog'd with, yet the ſame
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58466:188"/>Air, continually included in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, would, by its meer expanſion, without any new external heat, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a power of aſcending in ſpite of that weight; which aſcenſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be attributed to the water, which according to the Laws Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical ought <hi>(caeterisparibus)</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or buoy up more potently thoſe immerſed bodies, that being lighter <hi>in specie,</hi> than it, poſſeſs the greateſt place in it, and hinder the more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from acquiring its due ſituation: as we ſee, that among hollow ſpheres of glaſs and metal, equally thick and well ſtopp'd, there is a much heavier weight requiſite to ſink a large one than a ſmall one. For the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this tryal we began to pump the Air out of the great Receiver; and its preſſure upon the ſurface of the water being thereby more and more leſſen'd, (according to what we elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58466:188"/>more fully declare,) the ſpring of the included Air began by degrees to diſtend the ſides of the bladder, till at length that veſſel of Air ſwelling e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way took up ſo much more room in the water than it did before, that the water was able to lift the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the annexed weight to the top, and detain it there, till we thought fit to let in again ſome of the excluded Air, which forcing that in the bladder to ſhrink in its dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the weight was preſently able to ſink it to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>And here it may be noted, that if, inſtead of hanging ſo great a weight at the neck of the bladder, we faſtned but a moderately heavy piece of Lead, ſuch as would only ſerve to ſink the bladder, and keep it at the bottom of the water, ſo that the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of the Bladder, Air, and Metal, was but a little heavier than a bulk of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58466:189"/>water equal to them: Then upon the firſt ſuck or operation of the Pump, which could withdraw but a ſmall part of the Air in the Receiver, the Air in the bladder ſuddenly expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, would forthwith be impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly extruded by the water, though after ſome reciprocations it would float in its due poſition, till upon the return of a little outward air (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as little as we could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently let in) it would immediately ſubſide.</p>
                     <p>But this is not ſo neceſſary to be inſiſted on, as 'tis to take notice, that I foreſaw it may be objected, that the aſcenſion of the weight was not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the preſſure of the water, but by this, that Rarity and Levity being Qualities exceedingly of kinn, the great Rarefaction of the Air might proportionably increaſe the Levity of it, and conſequently enable it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58466:189"/>much greater things than it could do before.</p>
                     <p>I will not here diſpute, whether, generally ſpeaking, a body rarified without heat, would, in <hi>Vacuo,</hi> or in a fluid not heavier <hi>in ſpecie</hi> than the body when rarified, meerly by ſuch a greater diſtance of its parts as may ſuffice to entitle it to rarefaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come really heavier or lighter than before.

                     <p>This done, we let down the Viol into a conveniently ſhap'd Veſſel full of water, and the Viol, being poyſed before-hand for that purpoſe, ſunk perpendicularly in the liquor, till the neck of the Glaſs was partly above and partly beneath the ſurface of the water: Then covering the external Glaſs with a large Receiver, we caus'd the Air to be pump'd out, and as the preſſure of that was gradually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, the Air in the floating Viol did little by little expand it ſelf into the Bladder, and unfolded the winkles of it, till at length it became full blown without altering the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58466:190"/>poſture of the Glaſs it lean'd upon. But this great expanſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made above the Water, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in a medium not heavier than the included Air, gave that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rarified Air no ſuch increaſe of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as enabled us to perceive, that it made ſo much as the neck of the Glaſs ariſe higher in the Water than it did before. Nor did we take notice, that the return of the Air into the Receiver, by reducing the Air in the Bladder to its former unrarify'd eſtate, made the Glaſs ſink deeper than before. But when the Experiment was tryed with the ſame Glaſs and Bladder at the bottom of the Water, then, upon the pumping out the Air, the Bladder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dilated under water was after a while carried up to the top, and took up with it about eight or ten ounces, that had been, to clog it, faſten'd to the bottom of the Viol.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Do not think it were difficult for an intelligent peruſer of our Phyſico-Mechanical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to find there divers <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi> whence it may be deduc'd, that Bodies under water, though kept by that liquor from the immediate contact of the Air, may yet be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to its preſſure (whether the Air act as having a Weight or as a Spring.) But becauſe not only the Vulgar, but Philoſophers have been ſo long and generally poſſeſs'd with an opinion, that a fluid ſo little heavy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58466:193"/>as the Air, cannot by its weight act upon a liquor, that is, like water, bulk for bulk a thouſand times heavier than it: And becauſe alſo it ſeems yet more ſtrange, that a little Air, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not amounting to a ſcruple or drachm in weight, ſhould in its ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtate of Laxity act conſiderably upon Bodies, which, being cover'd with water, ſeem by the interpoſition of that liquor to be fenced from the incumbent Air; it may be worth while to add three or four Hydroſtatical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, to confirm a Truth that very few are yet acquainted with; and add to the proofs, already given of the power of the Spring of the Air, ſome of the operations we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it to have upon Bodies plac'd under water.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of Tryals, that I ſhall imploy to ſhew, that a ſmall quantity of incloſed Air may by its
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58466:193"/>preſſure (which in our caſes muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon its Spring) have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable operation upon bodies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, notwithſtanding the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that liquor.</p>
                  <p>For, this preſſure we ſpeak of, may be manifeſted, in the firſt place by what it directly and poſitively ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates upon bodies covered with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And in the next place, by the things that regularly enſue upon the removal of the inclos'd Air, or the weakning of its Spring.</p>

                     <p>TO begin with the former way of ſhewing the preſſure of the Air, I thought it ſufficient, in regard of the Tryals to be referr'd to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way, to make the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58466:194"/>
                     <p>We took a ſquare Glaſs-Viol, gueſs'd to be capable of holding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween half a pint and a pint of water; the neck of this we luted on carefully and ſtrongly (for elſe it would have been buoy'd up) over the orifice of the ſmall pipe, at which the Air paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in our Engine out of the Receiver into the Pump: Then whelming over this glaſs a great Receiver, we luted it ſtrongly to the Engine (that it might as well keep in the Water as keep out the Air) and at the top poured in as much water as ſufficed to inviron the internal Receiver (if I may ſo call it) and cover it to a pretty height. This done, we exactly cloſed with a turning key the hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> in the great Receiver, at which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been poured in, that no air might get in or out that way. And laſtly we began to pump out the Air contain'd in the internal Receiver;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58466:194"/>to the end that that Air, which by the above-mention'd pipe had Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the External Air, might no longer by its preſſure aſſiſt the glaſs to reſiſt the preſſure, which the incumbent and inclos'd Air; by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its Spring, conſtantly exerciſes upon the ſubjacent water, and by its intervention upon the ſides and bot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tom of the internal Receiver.</p>
                     <p>And as we expected not, that this glaſs by its own ſingle force ſhould reſiſt the preſſure of the Air inclos'd in the upper part of the great Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver notwithſtanding the interpoſition of the water; ſo the event fully juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our conjecture: For at the firſt exuction, which could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have well emptied the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glaſs, this veſſel was, by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſuperior Air upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtant water, broken into I know not how many pieces. And the ſame

                     <p>I Proceed now to the ſecond way of manifeſting the preſſure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd Air upon Bodies under water, which is by ſhewing the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> exhibited by thoſe Bodies upon the removal or leſſening of that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>Having ſqueez'd out of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſized Bladder the greateſt part of its Air, we tied the neck of it very cloſe, and then faſtning to it a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent weight, we plac'd it at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the talleſt and largeſt glaſs we could cover with our great Receiver, that ſo, though the incumbent Air
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58466:195"/>were pump'd out, none of the Water might be pump'd out with it, but ſtill retain the ſame height above the Bladder. Having then poured upon the Bladder as much Water as would ſwim a great way above the upper part of it, we cover'd this glaſs of Water with a great Receiver, which being carefully cemented on to the Engine, the Pump was ſet a-work, and as the Air, which by its Spring preſs'd upon the ſurface of the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Water, was by degrees pump'd out, ſo the Air that was impriſon'd in the Bladder, did gradually expand it ſelf at the bottom of the Water, as if no ſuch liquor had interpos'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them otherwiſe than by its weight, upon whoſe account it muſt be allowed to give ſome little impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to the expanſion of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in proportion to the height it had above it.</p>

                     <p>The Event of our Experiment was ſuch as was expected, namely that the immers'd Bladder was at length full blown, by the dilatation of the Air, inclos'd in it; and by its intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſcence made a conſiderable part of the Water run over by the ſides of the glaſs, that before contained it all.

                     <p>THere remain'd yet one tryal to be made, which in caſe it ſhould ſucceed, ſeem'd likely to appear as great an evidence of the force of the Air's Spring upon bodies under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as could be reaſonably deſired
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58466:197"/>of us; it having been look'd upon by many <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> as the conſiderableſt inſtance of the force of the Air's Spring even when no water interven'd in the tryal.</p>
                     <p>To ſatisfie therefore our curioſity, we took a copper Veſſel of a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical ſhape, and a conſiderable height; into this, being firſt almoſt filled with water, we put a ſquare Glaſs-Vial capable by gueſs to hold nine or ten ounces of water, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſtop'd with a cork and a cloſe Cement; this Vial by a competent weight was detain'd at the bottom of the water, from whoſe upper ſurface it was conſiderably diſtant: then the Copper Veſſel being plac'd upon the Engine, and included in a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver well cemented on, the Air was by degrees pump'd out, but before it was quite exhauſted, the Glaſs at the bottom of the water was, by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58466:198"/>ſpring of the Air included in it, burſt into many pieces, not without great noiſe, and a kind of ſmoak or miſt that appear'd above the ſurface of the water.</p>
                     <p>Another Glaſs of the ſame ſort had been broken after the ſame manner in another Veſſel; but having afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us no particular <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> I barely mention it, to ſhew that we made more than one tryal of this kind.</p>
                     <p>The conſequence that will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reſult from the three laſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, is this, that ſince barely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the withdrawing of the preſſure of the included Air (which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps but very little in quantity,) the Air reſiding in the immers'd bodies, did, by vertue of its Spring, expand it ſelf ſo forcibly as we have recited, and perform notable things, the Air above the Water muſt have exercis'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58466:198"/>a very powerful preſſure upon the ſurface of it, ſince, (ſetting aſide the weight of the water, of ſmall moment in our tryals,) it muſt have been at leaſt aequivalent to (and probably much exceeded) that force of the immers'd Air, whoſe exerciſe it was able totally to hinder.</p>
                     <p>And from hence it may be eaſily deduc'd, that the weight of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere acts upon bodies under water, notwithſtanding that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd liquor is by vaſt odds heavier <hi>in specie</hi> than Air; for, we have juſt now prov'd the preſſure of inclos'd Air, (which conſiſts in its Spring,) upon bodies under water; and 'tis manifeſt, that the ſtrength of the Spring of this inferiour Air, we make our tryals with, is caus'd by the weight of the ſuperiour Air, which bends and compreſſes thoſe little Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real ſpringy particles, whereof our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58466:199"/>Air conſiſts; ſo that the weight of the Atmoſphere being aequivalent to the Spring of the inferiour Air, (for elſe it could not compreſs it as much as it does,) muſt lean upon the ſurface of the ſubjacent water, with a force aequivalent to the ſpring of that part of it that is contiguous to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>This Experiment brings into my mind another that I once made, which though not properly Hydroſtatical, yet relating to poſitive Levity, may perhaps be not uſeleſly added on this occaſion; wherefore I ſhall here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn a tranſcript of the <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> that belongs to our preſent purpoſe, as 'tis regiſtred ſoon after the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment was made.</p>
                     <p>[To examine by a viſible Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment the common doctrine, that a portion of Air, by being much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, rarified or expanded, does
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58466:199"/>acquire a new and proportionable degree of Poſitive Levity, I devis'd to put in practice the following way:</p>
                     <p>We took a Bladder of a moderate ſize, that was very fine and limber, that it might be the lighter and more eaſily diſtended. The moſt part of the Air being ſqueez'd out of the Bladder, the neck of it was tied up very cloſe, that no air might get out of it, nor any (external) get into it. This limber Bladder was hung at one of the Scales of a Ballance, whoſe Beam had been purpoſely made more than ordinarily ſhort, that the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (which yet was tickliſh enough) might be ſuſpended, and capable of playing in the cavity of a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, into which we conveyed it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt carefully counterpoyſed the Bladder with a metalline weight put into the oppoſite ſcale.</p>
                     <p>This done, the Air was pump'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58466:200"/>out, and as that was withdrawn, the Bladder was more and more expanded by the Spring of the internal Air, till at length, when the Receiver was well exhauſted, it appear'd to be quite full. Notwithſtanding which great dilatation of the included Air, it did not appear by the depreſſion of the oppoſite ſcale, to be grown manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lighter than it was at firſt. And the Bladder ſeem'd alſo to retain the ſame weight, after it had, by the Air that was let into the Receiver, been compreſſed into its former wrinkled ſtate.]</p>

                  <p>SInce not only in vulgar Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Phyſico-Mechanical Experiments, but even among ſome Learned men it has prov'd a great impediment to mens freely acquieſcing in the doctrine founded on thoſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that if the Atmoſphere could really exerciſe ſo great a preſſure as we aſcribe to it, it would unavoidably oppreſs and cruſh all the bodies expos'd to it, and conſequently neither other Animals, nor Men would be able to move under ſo great a load, or ſubſiſt in ſpite of ſo forcible a compreſſion.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:58466:202"/>
                  <p>This I readily grant to be a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objection, but I ſuppoſe the force of it will be taken away by the following conſiderations put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, the power of preſſing, that we aſcribe to the Air, is not a thing deduced, as too many other conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences in Phyſick are, from doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſuppoſitions or bare <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> but from real and ſenſible Experiments. And therefore ſince we have clear and poſitive proofs of the Preſſure of the Air, though we could not explain how Men and other Animals are not deſtroyed by it; yet we ought rather to acknowledge our ignorance in a doubtful problem, than deny what experience manifeſts to be a Truth: As is generally practiſed in treating of the Attractive and other powers of the Loadſtone, which are freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged even by thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58466:202"/>themſelves unable to explicate them; though, if experience did not ſatisfie us of them, they were liable to divers more conſiderable objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than any that is urg'd againſt the Preſſure of the Air.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but though it be not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould anſwer the above-recited Objection otherwiſe, than by thus declaring that the Spring of the Air is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for it; yet we will endeavour very much to leſſen it, if not quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the difficulty, before we put an end to the diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>I conſider then thirdly, that they that urge the lately mention'd Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt the great Preſſure of the Air, ſeem not to be aware, that we were conceived and born in places expoſed to the preſſure of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, and therefore how great ſoever that preſſure appear to be, it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58466:203"/>ought not to cruſh us now, ſince when we were but embryos or new-born Babes, and conſequently very much more weak and tender than we now are, we were able to reſiſt it, and not only live, but grow in all dimenſions in ſpite of it.</p>
                  <p>If there were any place about the Moon, or ſome other of the Celeſtial Globes, that ſome Learned men fancy to be inhabited, that has no Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere, or equivalent Fluid about it, and where yet men could be generated a-new, if one of thoſe men ſhould be ſuppoſed to be tranſported thence, and ſet down upon our Earth, there might be made an Experiment fitted for our controverſie. In the mean time I doubt, that ſince Nature is not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make things ſuperfluouſly ſtrong, ſuch a humane body being not made to reſiſt any weight or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Air, would be of ſo tender
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58466:203"/>and compreſſible a make, that it would eaſily be cruſhed inwards by our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical preſſure. And though we cannot give an inſtance of this kind, yet we make tryals ſomewhat Analogous to it in our Pneumatical Engine. For when we place water in our Receiver, and pump out the Air that was above it, there will be generated a multitude of bubles, ſome of which, when the Air is carefully withdrawn, will be of a ſtrange and ſcarce credible bigneſs; theſe bubles being generated where the Air cannot preſs upon them, theſe dimenſions are ſo natural to them, that if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver be ſuppos'd not to leak, nor other unfriendly accidents to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, they would (for ought we know) laſt a good while; ſince I have elſewhere ſhewn, that the Spring of highly dilated Air did continue for many months, and a bladder
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58466:204"/>would for no leſs time continue blown and filled in our <hi>Vacuum</hi> by a little Air that was left in it, when the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient air began to be withdrawn from it. And yet the large bubles above mentioned, when once the outward air is ſuffered to come in upon them, are thereby ſo violently compreſs'd, that in a trice they ſhrink into dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, too ſmall to keep them ſo much as viſible; and if I could have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Attempt of producing ſuch living Bodies as I endeavour'd (but did not expect) in our <hi>Vacuum,</hi> I ſuppoſe the ſucceſs would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed what I have been ſaying.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; but you will tell me, that ſo great a weight and preſſure, as I aſſign the Atmoſphere, muſt needs make a man feel pain, and, if not otherwiſe diſlocate ſome of the parts, muſt at leaſt preſs the whole body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:58466:204"/>
                  <p>But firſt, being accuſtom'd to the preſſure from our very birth, and even before it, ſo early and long an accuſtomance hinders us from taking notice of it; thoſe preſſures only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible to us, that are made ſo by ſome additional cauſe, which by making a new impreſſion excites us to take notice of it. So we are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the weight of the cloths we are accuſtom'd to wear; and ſo a healthy man is not ſenſible of the heat in his heart becauſe 'tis conſtant there, and the ſentient parts of the heart have been ſtill us'd to it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that heat often-times has been very conſiderable; and when in living diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections a man puts his finger into the heart of an Animal, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably has a fainter, or at leaſt no ſtronger degree of heat than a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane heart, he will feel in his fingers, accuſtom'd to the Air, a manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58466:205"/>of heat, if they be but in their uſual temper. 2. I have elſewhere proved by Experiments, that a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick inch of Air, for inſtance, has as ſtrong a ſpring as ſuffices to enable it to reſiſt the weight of the whole At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, as far as it is expoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; for elſe it would be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd than <hi>de facto</hi> it is. And 3. I have alſo ſhewn, that a very little portion of Air, though it will much ſooner looſe its ſpring by expanſion than a greater, yet 'twill reſiſt further compreſſion as much as a greater. And 4. I have alſo ſhewn, that in the pores of the parts of Animals, whether fluid or conſiſtent, as in their Blood, Galls, Urines, Hearts, Livers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there are included a multitude of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real corpuſcles, as may appear by the numerous bubles afforded by ſuch Liquors, and the ſwelling or expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the conſiſtent parts in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58466:205"/>Receiver. 5. To this we may add, that, beſides the Bones, whoſe ſolidity is not queſtioned, a much greater part of the humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy than is wont to be imagined, does really conſiſt of Membranes and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and the coalitions and contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of theſe; and that theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are by the Providence of the moſt wiſe Author of Things made of a much cloſer and ſtronger Texture, than thoſe, that have not tried, will be apt to think; as I could make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable by the great force that Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will endure, and the very great weight that Tendons of no great thickneſs will lift up or ſuſtain, and by other things that I ſhall not now inſiſt on. Laſtly, There is a far greater difference, than men are wont to ſuſpect, between the effects of the Preſſures made upon Bodies by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent or otherwiſe applied ſolid
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58466:206"/>weights, and thoſe that they ſuffer from heavy but every way ambient fluids; as will appear by the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments to be mention'd by and by.</p>
                  <p>From the particulars contained in theſe conſiderations, we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to ſhew, why 'tis not neceſſary, that the preſſure of the Atmoſphere, though as great as we ſuppoſe it, ſhould oppreſs and cruſh the bodies of men that live under it: for, the ſolidity of the bones and the ſtrong Texture of the membranes and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, and the ſpring of the Aereal particles, that abound in the ſofter as well as in the fluid parts of bodies, is equivalent to the preſſure of as much of the Atmoſphere, as can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe its preſſure againſt them, and makes the frame of a humane body ſo firm, that it may well reſiſt the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the outward Air, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58466:206"/>any part violently diſlocated, whilſt the external preſſure is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed but by the Air, which being but an invironing fluid, preſſes it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as to ſenſe) on every ſide. And becauſe our bodies have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Atmoſphere, and from our very birth expoſed, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, to the preſſure of it; our continual accuſtomance to this preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the firmneſs of their ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, keep us from being ſenſible of the weight or preſſure. And that it was not impertinent for me to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the firmneſs of the frame of our bodies on this occaſion, I ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by an inſtance, that will upon another account alſo be proper for this place.</p>
                  <p>We know, that multitudes of men have had occaſion to paſs over high mountains; and, beſides that I have been my ſelf upon the Alps and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58466:207"/>Apennines, I have enquired of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, that have viſited the Aſian and American Mountains, and ſome that have been upon the top of the Pick of <hi>Tenerif</hi> it ſelf: But though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them took notice of a great difference in the Air at the top and bottom as to ſome other Quality, as coldneſs and thinneſs; yet I never met with; nor heard of any, that took notice of a difference as to the Weight of Air he ſuſtained, or that complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when he was come down to the foot of the Mountain, he felt any greater compreſſion from the Air than at the top. And yet the Experiments made as well by others as by our ſelves, ſufficiently witneſs, than on more elevated parts of the Earth, which have a leſs height of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere incumbent on them, the weight and preſſure of the Air is not ſo great as below. And on very high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58466:207"/>'tis not unlikely that this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference may be very conſiderable, ſince, when the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made near <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> upon the <hi>Puy de Domme,</hi> (which is none of the higheſt mountains in the world, being found by the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious makers of that obſervation to be but about 500 Fathoms,) they found the difference of the Mercury at the top and bottom to amount to about three inches: And conſequently, if the tryal had been made with Water inſtead of Quickſilver, the difference would have been about three foot and a half in the perpendicular height of the Water. And 'tis very probable, that in much higher Mountains, the difference of the Mercurial Cylinders height at the top and bottom may be much greater; and at the bottom of ſome very deep Well or Mineral groove, which may without improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58466:208"/>be ſuppoſed to be placed at or near the foot of one of theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, if we conceive the Baroſcope to be let down, the variation of the height of the Mercurial Cylinder may be yet much more conſiderable; and yet we find not that the diggers in the deepeſt Mines, in mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Countries, are ſenſible of being lean'd on or compreſs'd by any unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual weight. But not here to build on any thing but matter of fact, it appears by the newly named obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, when a man was at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the hill, he had as much greater weight of Air leaning upon his head than he had at the top, as was equal to the height of an imaginary veſſel full of water, which having his head for baſis, were three foot and a half high: which is ſo conſiderable a weight, as could not but have been, not only ſenſible, but very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58466:208"/>and uneaſie to ſupport. And what has been ſaid of the gravity of a pail of water, that leaned on his head, may be proportionably appli'd to his Shoulders, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence I think I may infer, that the reaſon, why ſuch a weight was not felt by the man it compreſs'd, was not, that the Air, that preſſed him, was not conſiderable, but that the preſſure was exerciſed after the uniform man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fluid Bodies.</p>
                  <p>And this may ſuffice to ſhew that there is no neceſſity that the compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Atmoſphere ſhould make it impoſſible to live in it. But becauſe 'tis obſerv'd, that thoſe that dive to great depths under water, are not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the great weight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent water, and the cauſe of this ſtrange <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be aſſigned, and therefore has been made one of the two grand argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58466:209"/>whereon the non-gravitation of water in water, and air in air has been, and ſtill remains, founded: I ſhall here offer ſomething <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti</hi> towards the ſolution of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and difficult Problem.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, that what is obſerv'd by the Divers, does not evince that water does not weigh in water, I have elſewhere
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical Paradoxes.</note> prov'd by ſuch reaſons and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as had the good fortune to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince eminently learned men, that were ſufficiently prepoſſeſs'd with the vulgar opinion: And in the ſame Treatiſe I have given a clear account, why a Bucket full of water is not felt conſiderably heavy, whilſt 'tis under water, in compariſon of what 'tis whilſt 'tis drawn up into the Air; which is the other <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> that I freſhly intimated the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be founded on.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58466:209"/>
                  <p>Next, I do not think it ſtrange, that that follows not which 'tis objected ſhould follow from our <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> namely, that a Diver ſhould be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently depreſs'd to the bottom of the water, by the weight of ſo great a Pillar of the Sea as is plac'd perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly over his body. For if we imagine a plane ſo to cut the Sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to paſs by the Divers body; then as that part of the plane, on which his body leans, will be preſs'd by It, together with the water that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly incumbent on it; ſo all the other parts of the ſame plane will be preſſed by equally tall Pillars of water perpendicularly incumbent on them; and conſequently, if the mans body were juſt equiponderant to an equal bulk of water, it and the water that leans on it would be ſuſtain'd by the preſſure of the collateral water incumbent on the other parts of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58466:210"/>ſame plane (as may be eaſily underſtood by what I have elſewhere ſaid.
<note n="*" place="margin">See Appendices to the Hydroſt. Paradox.</note>) And therefore there is no reaſon, why the Divers bodies ſhould be more forcibly depreſs'd than its depreſſion is reſiſted. 'Tis true, that this body will ſink, but that is becauſe 'tis not only, as we lately ſuppos'd it, aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderant to an equal bulk of water, but heavier than that. But then, ſince the Water by its gravity and reſiſtance takes off as much of the weight of the Divers body, whilſt that is immers'd, as a quantity of water equal to it would weigh in the Air, the ſubſiding of the humane body by its own weight ought to be but ſlow, becauſe that being not <hi>in ſpecie</hi> much heavier than water, it can ſink but by virtue of the ſurpluſage of weight that it has above water. And in effect, I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Swimmers, that in the Sea,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58466:210"/>whoſe water by reaſon of the Saltneſs is ſpecifically heavier than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water, they could hardly dive when they had a mind; the ſalt-water did ſo much ſupport them. And having, becauſe I had no convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to make tryals upon the parts of humane bodies, examin'd the weight of parts of other Animals in Air and Water, I found the overplus of the weight of the animal ſubſtances above an equal bulk of water to be but very ſmall. And this may ſuffice to take off the wonder, why, though water be admitted to gravitate in water, yet Divers are not depreſs'd by that which leans upon them; the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, they uſe to keep themſelves from ſinking by ſtriking the reſiſting water with their arms and legs, eaſily compenſating their weak tendency downwards, which the ſmall ſurplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of gravity above-mentioned gives them.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58466:211"/>
                  <p>But it ſeems to me far more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to render a reaſon, why thoſe that are a hundred foot beneath the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Sea, are not cruſh'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, eſpecially in their cheſts and abdomens, or at leaſt ſo compreſs'd as to endure a very great pain.</p>
                  <p>To clear up or leſſen this difficulty, I have two things to offer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I confeſs, that I am not intirely ſatisfied about the matter of fact; for I do not yet know, whether it fares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like with the Divers at all depths un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water: for, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers I obtain'd from perſons that had been one of them at the Coral-fiſhing in the <hi>Streights,</hi> and the other at the Pearl-fiſhing near <hi>Manar,</hi> I do not find that the Divers are wont to deſcend to the greateſt depths of the Sea, which if they did perhaps they would find a notable difference.</p>
                  <p>And in ſmall, or but moderate
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58466:211"/>depths, thoſe that dive without En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines uſually make ſuch haſte, or are ſo confounded, or have their minds ſo intent upon their work, that they take not notice of ſuch leſſer altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as elſe they might obſerve, eſpecially they being perſons void of curioſity and skill to make ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations. Which I the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe having met with a Learned Phyſician, that living by the Sea-ſide in a hot climate, delighted himſelf much in diving; and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him whether he felt no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, when he paſſed out of the Air into the Water, he anſwered me, that when he div'd nimbly as others uſe to do, he took not notice of it, but when he let himſelf ſink leiſurely into the water, he was ſenſible of an unuſual preſſure againſt his <hi>thorax,</hi> which he ſeveral times obſerved.</p>
                  <p>A man that gets his living by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58466:212"/>fetching up goods out of wrack'd Ships, complain'd to me, that if with his diving Bell he went very deep into the Sea, and made ſome ſtay there, he found himſelf much incommodated; which though he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the coldneſs of the water, yet by the ſymptoms he related I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to ſuſpect, that the preſſure of it upon the <hi>Genus Nervoſum</hi> might have an intereſt in the troubleſome effect. And I have been aſſured by an eminent <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that he was lately informed by a perſon, whoſe profeſſion it is to fetch up things from the bottom of the Sea by the help of a diving Bell, that ſeveral times when he deſcended to a great depth under the ſurface of the water, he was ſo compreſs'd by it, that the blood was ſqueez'd out at his Noſe and Eyes; which Relation ſeems to favour our conjecture, and would
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58466:212"/>much more confirm it, if I were ſure, that the effect was no way caus'd by ſome fermentation or other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the blood it ſelf, occaſioned by the great denſity or other altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Air he breath'd in and out, or by ſome other operation of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient <hi>Medium</hi> diſtinguiſhable from the compreſſion of the water, though perhaps conjoyn'd with it.</p>
                  <p>And on this occaſion I remember, that queſtioning an Ingeneer, who had made uſe of an Engine to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, quite differing from the Diving-bell; he anſwer'd me, that when he came to a conſiderable depth, he found the preſſure ſo great againſt the Leathern caſe, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and by that means againſt his belly and <hi>thorax,</hi> that he feared it would have ſpoiled him, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to make haſte up again. But this obſervation, to have much built
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58466:213"/>upon it, ſhould be further inquired into.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, and not theſe only, make me wiſh, that what is felt by thoſe that dive to great depths, and ſtay at them, might be more heedfully obſerv'd by intelligent men, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully inform'd what is true in point of fact, we may the better and more chearfully indagate the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, taking things as they are thought to appear, I ſhall propoſe two things towards the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our difficulty; namely the Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtructure of a humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Uniformity of the preſſure made by fluids.</p>
                  <p>Of the firſt of theſe I ſhall add but little to what has been already ſaid, where I ſpoke of the reſiſtance made by our bodies to the compreſſion of the Atmoſphere; only ſhall here take
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58466:213"/>notice, that whereas the Membranes are very thin parts, and therefore ſeem unfit to make any great reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; we have tried, that if a piece of fine Bladder were faſten'd to the orifice of a Braſs-pipe of about an inch in Diameter, we could not by drawing the Air from beneath it, make the weight of the Atmoſphere break the bladder, though the weight were perhaps aequivalent to an erected Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of water, of the wideneſs of the orifice and about 30. foot high, and we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e indeed ſuch, that divers men, that laid their hands on the orifice when the Air was pump'd out from beneath, complain'd, that they were not able to lift off their hands again till ſome of the Air was readmitted.</p>
                  <p>But the main thing, I ſhall propoſe towards the ſolving of the difficulty we are conſidering, is the Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity wherewith fluid bodies preſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58466:214"/>upon the ſolid ones that are placed in them. And becauſe I remember not to have met with Experiments pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made to ſhew, how this ſort of preſſure is more eaſie to be reſiſted than that of ſolids againſt ſolids, I ſhall ſubjoyn the following tryals.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="experiment">
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58466:214"/>
                     <head>EXPER. I.</head>
                     <p>IN the ſhort Cylinder of Braſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned we put a fine Bladder tied ſo cloſe at the neck, that none of the Air (whereof it was about half full) could probably get out. Which we did, to the end that the Hen-Egge, we were to bed in it, might lie ſoft, and have its ſides almoſt cover'd with the limber and flaccid Bladder and contained Air: This done, we covered the remaining part of the Egg with another Bladder, that nothing that was hard might come to bear immediately upon the ſhell: then we put the wooden plugg into the Cylinder and a weight upon the plugg, which is to be done very ſlowly and warily, leſt the quick deſcent of the weight ſhould make the plugg break the Egg it leans on.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58466:215"/>Laſtly, the Cylinder thus fitted, being cover'd with a large Receiver, and the Air being drawn out, that air, which was tied up in the Bladders, by degrees expanded it ſelf ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to lift up the plugg and the incumbent weight to a pretty heigth, and keep it there till the external Air was readmitted.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince 'twill be readily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and appears by divers Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments elſewhere related, that the Air in ſuch caſes expands it ſelf vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly every way, it appears by the recited tryal, that it preſſed againſt the Egg with the ſame force, that it preſs'd proportionably againſt the bottom of the Plugg, and that force was more than ſufficient to lift up the weight, which (together with the Plugg) amounted to about thirty pound, and yet the Egg being taken out appeared perfectly whole and no
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58466:215"/>way harmed; whereas upon the ſame Egg (if I miſtake not) or at leaſt another of the ſame kind, laying wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a while after ſmall weights one upon another, the Egg was cruſh'd to pieces by about four pound weight. This Experiment, though it ſeem'd conſiderable to thoſe that ſaw it, and may prevent an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for which reaſon I here mention it; yet will appear in no way ſtrange to them that conſider, that the weight of the Atmoſphere, which the Egg ſupported, before it was put into the Cylinder, was more than aequivalent to ſuch a preſſure of the Air, as may ſuffice to lift up the plugg: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought fit to make further try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of a differing nature.</p>

This Buble we included between Bladders, as we did the Egg in the former Experiment; and then having warily put the plugg into the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo as it might preſs upon the Bladder that inviron'd the Glaſs, we leiſurely put the weights upon the Plugg, till they together with the Plugg amounted to 30. pound or more, which being removed, the Plugg was taken out, and the Glaſs-buble, though it were extraordinarily thin, (perhaps no thinner than fine white Paper) was taken out whole.</p>

                     <p>Into a limber Bladder, almoſt full of water, we put a Hen-Egg, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neck very ſtrait, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might get in or out, we ſo plac'd the Bladder in the Braſs-Cylinder, that the Egg might not be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched by any thing that was hard; then putting the Plugg into the Cylinder, we warily and leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heaped upon it flat-bottom'd weights of Lead conveniently ſhaped, till they amounted (if both I and another miſremember not) to about 75 pound; notwithſtanding all which the Egg was taken out ſound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crack'd, and probably might have ſupported a much greater preſſure, if we had been furniſhed with more weights of a commodious figure to heap upon it.</p>
                     <p>If we compare with this what was noted at the cloſe of the firſt Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about the breaking of an Egg
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58466:217"/>with four pound weight, when no fluid body was interpoſed, it will be obvious to conclude, how great a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is between the reſiſtance that a body may make to the preſſure of ſolid bodies, that bear hard againſt ſome parts and not againſt others; and its reſiſtance to others that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it uniformly or in all places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. For though it be denied, and that, I think, upon very inſufficient grounds, that bodies under water are preſſed by the incumbent water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as 'tis pretended, the Elements gravitate not in their proper place; yet this objection cannot be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take place in our laſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, where the main thing that leaned upon the water, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the Egg, being not a Pillar of Homogeneous water, but a great and ſolid weight of Lead, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Egg muſt by the intervention
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58466:218"/>of the water have been compreſſed. Nor were Eggs the only bodies we endeavour'd to cruſh after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the tryal having been alſo made upon a ſubſtance more ſoft and of a very irregular ſhape.</p>
                     <p>To apply this now to Divers, when they are at a moderate depth under water; it ſeems not improbable, that the ſtructure of their bodies ſhould be robuſt enough not to be violated by the preſſure of the incumbent and otherwiſe ambient water. For we have ſeen by the former Experiments, and eſpecially by the laſt recited, that a body, eaſie to be broken inwards by an incumbent ſolid weight, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main intire and unaltered in point of figure, under a very much greater weight that compreſſes it after the manner of an ambient fluid. And though it would ſeem to many, that even in our ſuppoſition the <hi>Thorax,</hi>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:58466:218"/>being, as they think it, a kind of empty ſpace in the body, the ribs and muſcles ought by the weight of the water to be cruſhed into the great cavity intercepted between them; yet it is to be conſidered on the other ſide, that the Air contained in the cheſt, eſpecially when its Spring is increaſed by thoſe accidental cauſes, that may take place when men are deep under water, particularly the praeternatural heat, which the want of the uſual reſpiration is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, will very much help the cheſt to reſiſt the preſſure, as they will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily grant, that have tryed the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that Air makes, to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably compreſſed under water, the difficulty of farther compreſſing it ſtill encreaſing, as in Springs it ought to do, the more it is compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And I further obſerve, that the ſtructure of the <hi>Thorax</hi> is much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58466:219"/>more firm than men are wont to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; as appears by the very great ſolid weights, that ſome men do, for gain, or to ſhew their ſtrength, ſuffer to be laid on their breaſts, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any miſchief thereby. And if I ſhould admit, that at great depths, the water had ſome little compreſſive operation upon the cheſt; yet that can be no other than the preſſing the parts a little inwards, and that the ſtructure of the <hi>Thorax</hi> it ſelf, fitted by nature for conſtriction and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (as may appear in vehement takings in and blowings out of the Air) may admit with ſmall incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. To which purpoſe I recall to mind, what I lately mentioned concerning the Phyſician, that found his <hi>Thorax</hi> ſomewhat compreſſed when he leiſurely dived; as alſo what I have
<note n="*" place="margin">In the Append. to Hydroſt. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where delivered concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58466:219"/>a Tad-pole, which ſwimming in water that was ſtrongly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, by an external force, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thorough the Glaſs, that contained the water, to be ſomewhat leſſen'd in bulk, and yet not killed, nor ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly cruſhed notwithſtanding its great tenderneſs. And if there were parts of a human body, that were of a Texture too weak and too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate to the reſt, I think it poſſible, that this compreſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards might be great enough to be very ſenſible to the Divers. For having purpoſely inquired of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man, whoſe trade 'twas to fetch up goods out of Ships caſt away, by the help of a diving inſtrument, he told me, that when he was at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable depth under water, as about ten or twelve Fathoms, he found, ſuitably to my conjecture, ſo great a preſſure againſt the drums or thin
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58466:220"/>membranes of his Ears, which were not ſufficiently counterpreſs'd from within, as put him to a great deal of pain, till he had found ſome contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to leſſen the inconvenience. Nor was this man the only Diver that has complained of this troubleſome preſſure, which ſeems to argue, that, at leaſt at great depths under water, the firmneſs of the ſtructure of a mans body does concurr with the uniformity of the fluids preſſure, to keep him from being hurt by the incumbent and otherwiſe ambient water.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall now ſay no more of the Problem obout Divers, ſince (beſides that the matter of fact is not yet in my opinion accurately enough ſtated and determined,) the true ſolution of it is not neceſſary to give a reaſon, why the weight of the Air, a fluid ſo much ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
